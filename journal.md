Meeting with M--: summarizing my "Digital Methods and Textualities" list by subsection, in preparation for my rationale.

### Methods

* Moretti, Franco. *Graphs, Maps, Trees: Abstract Models for Literary History*. 2007. Print.
* Drucker, Johanna. "Introduction," *SpecLab: Digital Aesthetics and Projects in Speculative Computing*. 2009. PDF.
* Ramsay, Stephen. *Reading Machines: Toward an Algorithmic Criticism*. 2011. Print.
* Drucker, Johanna. ["Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display."](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/1/000091/000091.html) *DHQ: Digital Humanities Quarterly*. 2011. Web. 
* Felski, Rita. *The Limits of Critique*. 2015. PDF.
* Piper, Andrew. *Enumerations: Data and Literary Study*. 2018. Print.
* Rockwell, Geoffrey and Stefan Sinclair. [*Voyant-Tools*](https://voyant-tools.org/). 2018. 

My sources here fall into two camps: the positivists (Moretti) and the deformers/speculators (Ramsay, Drucker, Felski, Piper). I'm interested in how each deploys empirical methods---of the senses and sense-making---in their work. There are connections to my list with J--, "Theories of the Mind and Perception," where I look at cognition and thinking/feeling. How do these processes happen in the brain? More synthesis to be done here. 

In this section, looking at *Voyant-Tools* as the tool par excellence of the kind of  hermeneutic that digital tools ought to engage. A text visualization tool that makes formal intervetions on the textual object, but cannot do so without the critics input at each step (from uploading the text to interacting with the visualizations). A tool that effaces its own technical construction (the javascript code that powers it) in order to emphasize *modeling* as a critical activity. 

### Language

* Barthes, Roland. *S/Z*. 1970. Print.
* Fisher, Caitlin. [*These Waves of Girls*](https://www.yorku.ca/caitlin/waves/navigate.html). 2001. Web.
* Landow, George. *Hypertext 3.0: Critical Theory and New Media in an Era of Globalization*. 2006. Print.
* Tenen, Dennis. *Plain Text: the Poetics of Computation*. 2017. Epub.
* Gaboury, Jacob. ["Becoming NULL: Queer Relations in the Excluded Middle."](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0740770X.2018.1473986) *Women & Performance: a Journal of Feminist Theory*. 28:2, 2018. pp. 143-158. Web.

Most of these sources are about encoding or tagging---the invisible data that appends electronic text. Barthes and Landow are idealistic in how codes may unleash meaning (writerly text & hypertext), While Tenen sees codes as disempowering. He warns against the disenfranchisement that comes with easy and seamless reading interfaces. What makes codes illegible evacuates our critical understanding. 

There's a question of pleasure: Does pleasure reside more in the collapsing of the interface (between reader and text) or in the evcavation of the textual conduit? A question to be taken up in my *Media* section... 

Here, looking at *These Waves of Girls*, a hypertext novella, there is a pleasure in following the text, in chasing narrative closure, that is not unlike sexual pleasure and frustration. The narrator's quest of sexual discovery parallels the reader's quest across the labrynthine narrtive, which defies rest and full understanding. 

### Networks

* Galloway, Alexander. *Protocol: How Control Exists after Decentralization*. 2004. PDF.
* Chun, Wendy. *Control and Freedom: Power and Paranoia in the Age of Fiber Optics*. 2006. Print.
* Bennett, Jane. *Vibrant Matter: A Political Ecology of Things*. 2010. PDF.
* Moten, Fred and Stefano Harney. *The Undercommons: Fugitive Planning & Black Study*. 2013. Epub.
* Klein, Lauren F. ["The Image of Absence: Archival Silence, Data Visualization, and James Hemings."](https://read.dukeupress.edu/american-literature/article-abstract/85/4/661/4953/The-Image-of-Absence-Archival-Silence-Data?redirectedFrom=fulltext) *American Literature*, 85 (4): 661–688. 2013. Web.
* Tufekci, Zeynep. *Twitter and Tear Gas: the Power and Fragility of Networked Protest*. 2017. PDF.

Networks are run by protocols, which enable and structure connections. What kinds of connections are facilitated by different kinds of protocols? Can we see protocols as an analogue to critical stances, such as suspicion vs. wonder? 

Paradox of control/freedom (Chun and Galloway): Despite the restrictions of protocol, there is a freedom in the possibility of connection. Each node is free to connect to another. This may allow us to rethink the element of control, of disambiguation/fixity required by the computer. If protocols append data with possibility (Galloway), there opens a space to manipulate control, in the site of contact. There is vulnerability at the site of contact (Chun). 

The "Image of Absence" looks to the networks of connection between what has been lost in the archive, rather than attempt to recover or replace. The archive as a site of action rather than fixity or loss. 

### Media

* Kittler, Friedrich. *Gramophone, Film, Typewriter*. 1999. Print.
* Hayles, N. Katherine. *Writing Machines*. 2002. PDF.
* Kirschenbaum, Matthew. *Mechanisms: New Media and the Forensic Imagination*. 2008. Print.
* Blanchette, Jean-François, "(A Material History of Bits)[https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezproxy.gc.cuny.edu/doi/epdf/10.1002/asi.21542]." *Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology*, no. 62: pp. 1042-1057, 2011. 
* Hansen, Mark. *Feed-Forward: On The Future of 21st Century Media*. 2014. Epub.
* Woolf, Virginia, Emily McGinn, Amy Leggette, Matthew Hannah, and Paul Bellew. ["Comparing Marks: A Versioning Edition of Virginia Woolf's 'The Mark on the Wall.'"](http://scholarlyediting.org/2014/editions/intro.markonthewall.html) *Scholarly Editing: The Annual of the Association for Documentary Editing*. Vol. 35, 2014. Web.
* Peters, John Durham. The Marvelous Clouds: Toward a Philosophy of Elemental Media, 2016.

I keep coming back to this Kittler quote: “Whosoever is able to hear or see the circuits in the synthesized sound of CDs or in the laser storms of a disco finds happiness” (xl-xli).

Many interests here: 
- The pleasure and sensation in hard media versus "formal" media. 
- The bit---a symbol of a polarity differential---as a foundation for mediation.
- Kirschenbaum's framework of formal and forensic materiality. A media archaeologial perspective. 
- The abstraction of digital media allows us to overlook their sensuality.

Should editing be resorative? 

Do the unresolvable obstacles or limitations of computation (most convincingly pointed out by McGann and Caughie, to different effects) suggest that, maybe, some things shouldn't be resolved? For Caughie, do we *want* a gender ontology that can be hard coded? Do we want to fix gender so it is legible? How to make things findable and dynamic? Should we expand TEI (Singer)?

**M--'s suggestions:**
- What are the usable concepts? What would I be writing about in an article five years from now? What do I want to take with me? 
- "Reading like a hawk." Do not succumb to the other's argument, do not get lost. 
- Read *Distant Visions* or the article from *Cultural Analytics*.
- There will always be something new to read in this field. Don't go chasing these down. But maybe read Nan Z. Da's critique of Cultural Analytics in *Cultural Analytics*. See Liu and Underwood's tweets here.

Digital: Editing notes

Questions:

**Should editing be restorative?**
- Tanselle vs Mackenzie --- both consider the ideal text versus McGann who considers the n-dimensional text.
- Tanselle --- the idea that physical forms are corrupting/corrupted and require the help of an editor; Mackenzie --- each witness is a branch of an ideal text, which is never to be realized (but animates the creation of the witnesses).
- Against McGann, who thinks (electronic) editing should break open texts. This takes Mackenzie’s tree of witnesses and cuts off the trunk. McGann doesn’t think any one text should be prioritized.   

**How do we maintain texts editorial methods / edited text without perpetuating their readings? Or recover without overwriting or determining?** In other words, how can we open rather than constrain or delimit meaning?
- Tanselle vs Mackenzie (a history of misreadings) and McGann.
- One is conservative, the other two are not. 

**The irony of the archive**---that it works against itself. Putting something on the outside makes it vulnerable to destruction / pursuing the death drive / expresses the desire to destroy it. 
- The moment proper to the archive, the (technological) moment of impression. When the key is pressing on the paper, that is the moment of archivization.

**Disambiguation and creativity:**
- McGann separates editorial projects (archives) from hermeneutic projects (prosthetic tools). Though he seems to loosen his thinking on this point, this is a division between informational and analytical uses of technology, of science and poetry, which is outdated. 
- Caughie et al.---showing how questions about computer disambiguation brings us to look at our own categories and definitions. Also that these issues shouldn’t necessarily be resolved, we ought to keep open the sense of confusion about gender. We don’t need a solution. We need a way of showing dynamicity while still being findable.

Notes: ADD SEX, OR THE UNBEARABLE to QM

Digital: Media reading:

**Where can we locate pleasure in media?**
- Kittler’s pleasure in the circuits? “Whosoever is able to hear or see the circuits in the synthesized sound of CDs or in the laser storms of a disco finds happiness” (xl-xli).
- Pleasure in the media archaeology, in forensics. 

**What can media tell us about sensation?**
- The idea that media developments are cyclical and recursive. Orality was followed by writing, followed by the recording of orality (Kittler). Current (and prior) sense perceptions elided by present technology may in the future come to be recorded and felt.

**Where lies the distinction between media (such as analogue and digital) for these writers?** 
- According to Kittler: symbolic (writing) → physical (gramophone, film, typewriter) → electronic (pulses). 
- According to Hayles, all media is remediation, it cycles through other media. A TV screen that evokes a computer screen. A computer screen that evokes a printed page. 
- According to Kirschenbaum, the difference is between forensic materiality (hardware (no matter how nanoscale)), and formal materiality (the illusion of immaterial, the interface).  
- According to Hansen, media engages connects to our perceptions, new media have expanded our perceptual reach (an environmental sensibility), and as a result our consciousness is anticipatory. It feeds forward. 
- According to Klein, new media allows us to bring to the fore things that cannot be represented, and to leave them like that. We use digital media to evoke connections that are active and moving, not presences that are fixed or recovered. 

**Media and subjectivity / narration / literature**
- Hayles’ remediated narrator--- the idea that mediation fuses consciousness with levels/technologies of inscription. This replaces modernity’s unreliable narrator. 

All of these critics (except maybe Hansen) are a critique of Kittler in some way. They assert that, in fact, electronic media is more than streams of data, pulses of light, “eyewash”. The benefits of examining how “information lost its body” are clear here---but what are the benefits of seeing digital media as just pulses of light? Maybe Hansen can help answer this question. 

The bit is inaccessible to us except in the symbol. This is really the foundation of … mediation?

**How does RAM, which emerged due to an addressing problem, operate like human memory?**

Digital: Networks reading:

What is most provocative in theses readings is thinking about networks as run by protocols (standards of control, which facilitate connections between nodes,) and how to work with such protocols in order to subvert their inherent means of hierarchical, top-down control. The trick is to think of the kinds of connections facilitated by different kinds of protocols. **What if we approached things from a position of wonder, fascination, rather than from a position of critique? What if we resolved to study together, collect debt, steal from the university, feel each other, rather than do the work of professionalization?** This idea about protocol as necessary for networks brings us to rethink what a protocol might be. 

Questions:
**What is a network?**
- A network is communication. A network does not exist unless there is a giving and taking.  Therefore, one might conjecture that the more open and frequent the communication the stronger the network. 
- If a network is just communication, we ought to think of it as two way communication. There is no subject or object, just the flow of information from one to the other, and a feedback. It is all part of the same organism, the network. 
- We ought to recognize the difference between a network and a swarm:
    - A swarm is purpose-driven. A network may not have a purpose, and are prerequisites for swarms to form. This plays into what Tufekci says about the drawbacks of horizontalism. A swarm is horizontal, but it’s goal-oriented, so it can more readily avoid tactical freeze. A network has no consensus. 

**What does the paradox of control/freedom in networks afford for our thinking?** 
- It allows us to transcend our thinking of computers as disambiguation machines. There is an element of control inherent to the way a computer network works---there are rules, codes, which require a certain level of disambiguation and fixity in our data. It doesn’t allow for much freedom of content. However, each node is free to connect to any other node. There is a potentiality of connection, where the freedom derives. So, despite the constriction of standards/content, there is a freedom of connection.
- We have to think of freedom in the network as the potential to connect, to engage, to exchange information. 

**What do protocols make possible?**
- Protocols (essentially tags) do not change data, but append it with possibility. The possibility in the protocol is a space where we can manipulate or elide control (Galloway). 
Protocols make possible the connection, a touching of one node and another. There is a site of contact, of engagement. 
- They make possible *vulnerability*. 
    - The exposure of being visible is what can create possibilities (Chun).
    - “Protocol is synonymous with possibility” (Galloway 167). 
    - "Deciding (and often struggling for) what is possible is the first step in a utopian vision based on desire, based in what one wants. Hackers are machines for the identification of this possibility” (Galloway 169).

Galloway versus Chun on the possibilities of “cyberspace”---they approach this differently. While Chun is more cynical about cyberspace being an illusion where people might dispose with their alterity and inhabit a default “white” position, Galloway says that there is possibility there. Not sure.

**How do we approach or resolve the drawbacks of horizontalism?** 
- The positive aspects of horizontalism (democracy and improvisation) lead to the negative effects of tactical freeze and inability to secure consensus. Networks can easily make promises and threats, but ultimately cannot carry these out as efficiently. 

**What is the role of fascination, wonder, naivete in thinking about objects or networks?**
- The role of fascination over critique suggests that there is always something more to know, there is always a connection to be made between ourselves and the world around us. We ought to impose a state of wonder or naivete in order to be susceptible to these potential connections.
- A state of wonder is the aesthetic for enlarging our networks. Fascination, wonder, is a protocol. It is one way for making connections. Alexander Galloway repeatedly makes the point that code is the ony language that is executable. It moves.  

**How can one be inside of the network and yet resist the network?**
- By forging connections that are outside of the established “connections”. In other words, by stealing, by feeling each other, by collecting debt, never paying it off, by collective study. 
The Undercommons suggests ways for subverting the control and protocols of the network, by finding exploits such as stealing, feeling, collecting debt, collective study. These are all ways we can connect to each other within the university without being part of the university. 

## February 21 -- undercommons

Digital: Language subsection. Looking Barthes, Tenen, Landow (and adding Fisher, *These Waves of Girls*).

In a way, all about the role of text encoding, or “tagging” or processing text in order to interpret or present that text on a computer screen:
- Barthes’ encoding scheme in S/Z,
- George Landow’s rather idealistic views on the potential of hypertext to enact post-structuralist and deconstructive theories. 
- Dennis Tenen (recent) account of embedded encodings that protect digital media (for example, copyright restrictions coded into a kindle edition). 

B, L and T agree that deformance is key to interpretation. But they see these play out in ways that alternately empower and disenfranchise the reader/writer.  B and L seem to be more idealistic about the potential of codes to unleash meaning, in the power of the “writerly text", while Tenen recognizes that text’s can also be tethered and stabilized by these same codes.
- Tenen, however, deepens the conversation about encoding by bringing the architecture and hardware/software of the computer into the picture. The text on the screen actually hides the ways in which it is already determined across many layers. It’s not just about the codes that we use to tag (and therefore delimit) text, but it’s also about the ways that text becomes mediated through the “textual conduit”, from keyboard to hard drive to screen. Tenen says that the easier this process becomes, the more seamlessly it occurs, the more pleasure and accordingly, less legibility (and potential for critical thought) for the reader/writer. Tenen usefully brings the question of pleasure into the question of encoding, how pleasure in fact engages with the critical process. 

**How does the legibility or obscurity of mediation between us and our texts affect the way we read them?**
- According to Barthes, mediation through codes increases pleasure, for it multiplies meaning and engages the writerly aspects of text. 
- Similarly, according to Landow, mediation becomes a plaything, insofar as it allows us to deform, decenter, or deconstruct the original text. Landow does not talk too much about the codes that facilitate this playing around with text. In this way he succumbs to the illusions of the “fractured sign” pointed out by Tenen. He talks as if the words on the screen are simply appearing and disappearing, propelling and disrupting, the text. 
Tenen argues that any decrease in legibility of the technical processes can only diminish the intellectual interventions that we make upon text. No matter what else happens, any obscuration of textual processes will affect how we read that text, and how we take power over the interpretive process. 

**Does the pleasure reside in collapsing the interface between reader and text or in the excavation of the textual conduit that produces and manifests text?** There is an element of pleasure in the immediacy of digital media, and also in the feeling/seeing of the mediatory process. 

## February 16

I've been thinking about my stakes. Alan Liu's talk about infrastructures yesterday made me question what I really care about. As stupid as this sounds, it's the risk of not feeling. It's I think not taking advantage of the networks of feeling, embodied feeling, cognition and perception in texts, our inheritance. The stakes are submitting to a method that elides the (what I see as) essential emotive and motive qualities of literature. Which is exactly why I need to write more in this book. 
Something that we are missing, a pleasure in the pain of identification? The torment of queer literature?

## February 6 2019 -- at the *Undercommons* writing group

This week I'm synthesizing material from my Digital Studies: Methods subtopic. Here I’m looking at methods, or specific reading strategies, proposed by several theorists who generally work in the Digital Humanities field. I examine the role of vision, rhetoric, reasoning, speculation, and affect as “interpretive” moves in critical reading practices. The debate between the different methods generally falls into one of two opposing sides: the positivists, who posit that we can ascertain truth and verifiable (what Moretti calls “falsifiable”) readings of texts, versus the deformers/speculators, who deny and refuse falsifiable criticism, in favor of reading practices that equivocate or deepen textual meaning. This group values the process of reading over the product. 

I am most interested in how these two camps interpret and deploy the role of empiricism, the role of the senses and then of sense-making through rhetoric, in critical methods.

## December 27

I've finalized my Digital Studies list. Major changes include replacing Derrida's *Of Grammatology* with Barthes' *S/Z* in my **Language** section (the reason being that Barthes' poststructuralism works better with the focus on hyperlinks), and Chartier's "Laborers and Voyagers" with Derrida's *Archive Fever*, in **Editing** (Derrida's essay more directly addresses issues of absence/presence and desire for legibility/trunth that are explored in the other readings).

Besides these, I also finalized the sixth item for each section, which contains a literary or literary critical work that illustrates the theoretical debates therein. These are the following:
* in **Methods**, I added [*Voyant-Tools*](https://voyant-tools.org/), a web-based text analysis application that demonstrates how the reader is implicated in "distant reading", and the role of speculation in critical praxis. 
* in  **Language**, I added *Patchwork Girl*, which, though I haven't actually read, seems to be relevant to the focus on connections between technology and embodiment, the development of hypertext language, using technology to draw attention to the fragmentation of meaning. 
* in **Networks**, I added [*These Waves of Girls*](https://www.yorku.ca/caitlin/waves/navigate.html), which is a hyperfiction novella, published in 2001 (and won an ELO Award). The novella explores the young female narrator's sexual development, and uses the proliferation of hyperlinks to disrupt the reading experience, posing desire for narrative closure against other (sexual) curiosities.
* in **Media**, I added ["The Image of Absence,"](https://read.dukeupress.edu/american-literature/article-abstract/85/4/661/4953/The-Image-of-Absence-Archival-Silence-Data?redirectedFrom=fulltext) an essay by Lauren Klein, which shows (again) the different kinds of reading, and encourages us to rethink "surface reading", reading for what is absent, in a way that "animates the mysteries of the past," rather than attemptting to recover them.
* Finally, in **Editing**,  I added ["Comparing Marks: A Versioning Edition of Virginia Woolf's 'The Mark on the Wall'"](http://scholarlyediting.org/2014/editions/intro.markonthewall.html). This "versioning edition" of Woolf's short story illustrates how attention to a text's many forms/materialities can reveal previously unforeseen/unanticipated agencies that alter the way we read the story. 

## December 21

Had a really helpful and productive meeting with J-- today. 

Some suggestions for literature:
- Baldwin, James. "My Dungeon Shook," 1963.
- Hudsvedt, Siri. *The Shaking Woman or A History of My Nerves*, 2010.
    * An essay/memoir about speaking in public. Would go under "Thought/Feeling: Neuroscience"

Some suggestions of theoretical / critical work:
- LeDoux, Joseph. [*Anxious: Using the Brain to Understand and Treat Fear and Anxiety*](https://www.amazon.com/Anxious-Using-Brain-Understand-Anxiety-ebook/dp/B00OYXWLBU), 2015.
    * Not the entire book, but there is a chapter on theories of consciousness, from neurological perspectives, things I would want to explore. Also info on cognitive assemblages.  
- Damasio, first chapter of *The Feeling of What Happens*, and then his more recent book, [*Self Comes to Mind*](https://www.amazon.com/Self-Comes-Mind-Constructing-Conscious-ebook/dp/B003WUYOKM/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1545507317&sr=1-1&keywords=damasio+self+comes+to+mind), 2010.
- Noe, Alva. [*Out of Our Heads: Why You Are Not Your Brain, and Other Lessons from the Biology of Consciousness*](https://www.amazon.com/Out-Our-Heads-Lessons-Consciousness/dp/0809016486), 2010. 
- Dahaene, Stanislas. [*Reading in the Brain: The New Science of How We Read*](https://www.amazon.com/Reading-Brain-New-Science-Read/dp/0143118056), 2010.
- Malabou, Catherine. [*What Should We Do with Our Brain? (Perspectives in Continental Philosophy*](https://www.amazon.com/Should-Brain-Perspectives-Continental-Philosophy/dp/082322953X), 2008. 
    * Maybe ust a chapter from here. 
- Pittx-Tayler, Victoria. [*The Brain's Body: Neuroscience and Corporeal Politics*](https://www.amazon.com/Brains-Body-Neuroscience-Corporeal-Politics/dp/0822361264), 2016. 
    * Feminist synthesis of neuroscience.


Some suggestions for revising/organizing my lists and strategies for the exam:
- Focus it, deal with feeling & phenomenology.
- Lose Searle, and Nagel could stay or go (it's often cited), Turing could also go, unless you want to keep it for historical reasons.
- There's too much--eliminate a category or reshuffle... you might move the Cognition, Empiricism, and Speculative Realism sections into *two* categories, and from there, begin to cut works. The categories might be
    * Thought & Feeling: Philosophy
    * Thought & Feeling: Neuroscience
- Once I have those two categories as my foundation, I can add the other subtopics (Posthuman and Colors) as more tangential areas. 
- Make it feel organic and like everything fits tightly together. This is more important than being comprehensive. Keepign it shorter will also make it easier for you to be in charge during the exam. 
- Explain fully the digital component to people who are unfamiliar.
- What are the implications for reading the texts on Wayne's list? How does Hayles help us read *Orlando*?
- Where in the text do digital methodologies arise?
    * Where are the intersections of the two above questions?
- Cut five works, any doubles of a single author (W-- said the same thing)
- *Elusive Brain* explores implications. 
- The goal isn't to create a field that reduces the issue.
- Contact J-- in last week of January. 

***

Coming at this a couple of days later---I've been seriously considering about what J-- says regarding the coherence/unity of the list being more important than coverage... So I removed entirely the *Colors* subtopic and and renamed *Posthuman* to *Thinking/Feeling: the Posthuman* (I might further adjust the title to fit more squarely with digital studies as a field). One book, Delporte's *Journal*, survived for now, switched to *Thinking/Feeling: Philosophy*. It may not make sense to keep it anymore, but I remain attached.


## December 20

In preparation for my meeting with J-- tomorrow, I think I should spend some time articulating my research interests and questions. 

Most broadly, I'm interested in Digital Studies, and Theories of Consciousness / Philosophy of the Mind, with a focus on Queer Modernist texts, particularly life writing, such as autobiography, memoir, and journals and manuscripts, but also fictionalized biography.

With regard to Digital Studies, I'm interested in **how digital tools/methods encourage *speculation* or *nonverbal/affective* reactions as a critical reading practice.** This covers all kinds of reading, such as "distant,"close," "surface," or "deformative" / "algorithmic." Some examples of my work in this vein includes examinations of *Voyant-Tools* (a browser-based text analysis application), specifically how the "distance" of "distant reading" reinforces a *speculative* (rather than "objective" or "faslifiable," in the words of Franco Moretti) method by taking users to previously unforeseen places. Besides that, I'm also working on [modifying a digital annotation tool](https://github.com/gofilipa/digital_annotation) to include multi-color functionality on the hightlighter, in order to engage more directly preverbal on nonverbal affects in the reading process.

In exploring this process of reading, I'm also interested in **the parallels between cognition and computation** (where my interest intersects with J--'s work). How do digital tools facilitate embodied interactions with text? To answer this, I plan to examine biological processes of perception, and figures of analogy between man and machine, such as the cyborg and the posthuman. 

My prefered objects of study for this kind of investigation are first person autobiography or memoir, journals or manuscripts, or fictionalized autobiography/biography, which engages the writing as a process---in form and composition---and troubles the coherence of the queer subject. **How do the structures/logics/abstractions of technology/code complicate queer subjectivity? Or, is it possible to *encode* queerness?**

I think my dissertation will attempt to address the following questions in some way: How do digital tools engage queer embodiment / embodied affects? How does perception (thinking and feeling) work? And how do these processes relate to computation?

## December 19

I need to update on my meeting with W-- last week, but that will have to wait for another day. First, I'm going through my Perception list one more time before my meeting with J-- tomorrow. Over the past two days, I've made some dramatic (necessary?) changes to this list. I cut out a whole lot of works and consolidated subtopics. The survivors are:
- Posthumanism & Bodies: Haraway, Hayles, Elizabeth Wilson & Richard Powers
- Cognition & Computation: Various 20thC essays, Varela, Damasio, Chalmers, Dahaene, Hayles & Alain Robbe-Grillet or J. Tougaw
- Colors & Emotions: Newton, Goethe, Wittgenstein & & Julie Delport
- Empiricism: Hume, Bergson, W. James, Merleau-Ponty & Moretti and Boone
- Speculative Realism: Whitehead, Stengers, Shaviro & Santiago Ramon y Cajal

The total comes out to just under 30. This seems about right. There are other concerns, things I may want to add (or swap in):
- a feminist perspective---most of these works (excepting the Posthuman section) are written by men, and gender perhaps ought to factor into the Cognition, Empiricism, and Speculative Realism sections. 
- a list of "greatest works" of literary criticism that engages with cognitive studies/themes/models. They might be proto-cognitive---not directly engaging or empoying cognition, but evocative or resonant of it. Specifically, I'm thinking of work by Boone or J. Tougaw. 
- potentially, add a list of "neuronovels" or "brain memoirs", as J. Tougaw calls them. 

Okay, now that those issues are out of the way, I can begin to examine this list, subtopic by subtopic, to get a sense of the questions that I am asking of them, and how they fit into the whole.

**Posthumanism & Bodies**
- How do historical and scientific discourses about technology address the body, emotions, affects, and gender?
- What is the relationship between the analogy of machine/body and software(code)/mind? How is this embodied by the posthuman and cyborg?

**Cognition & Computation**
- How is thinking like computation? What is the historical understanding of this relationship?
- Where is consciousness located---in the mind, body, or somewhere else?

**Colors & Affect**
- What is the historical understanding of the *location* of color? In the mind, eye, object, or light?
- What is the relationship between color and affect? How do certain colors or color combinations engage emotions?

**Empiricism**
- How do we understand the historical emergence and development of empiricism?
- How does W. James and Merleau-Ponty begin to trouble the empiricist notions of observation, experimentation, falsification, with the presumption of a rational and authoritative mind?

**Speculative Realism**
- What are the terms of the debate between Speculative Realism and Correlationism?
- How is *knowing* an *aesthetic* experience? What is the role of emotion and affect in knowing?
- How do the conclusions of Speculative Realism play out against the issues of cognition vs computation, the location of consciousness, and the role of affect in perception, as explored in my other subtopics?

## December 17

I made an interesting change in my Digital Studies list, which has also bled into my Theories of Perception and the Mind list: instead of having a separate section of primary works (such as science/hyper -fiction and digital archives), what if I add those works individually to the end of each subtopic, as a kind of "demonstration" of the critical interventions made therein? For example, *Woolf Online* and *Infinite Ulysses* move to the **Editing** subtopic, and *Galatea 2.2* goes to the **Posthuman** section. These creative pieces will then become weekend reads, with a lower pressure. 

## December 8

Earlier this week, I met with M-- to talk about my digital list. The meeting went very well--he was totally supportive and encouraging of my choices so far, and seemed to appreciate what I could explain about my project. 

He helped me to cut out some works, to add a few more, and to consider strategies for approaching the exam. His specific suggestions include
- Despite one of my research questions being about gender/queerness, this list is really missing texts on those topics. Some suggestions that address this
    * consider *Data Feminism* (draft published online) by Lauren Klein. 
    * consider article by Laura Mandell in forthcoming *Debates*, about TEI & binaries.
    * consider either "Queer OS" article by Jacob Gaboury (in 2016 *Debates*), or the more extensive chapter in Routledge's *Media Studies* collection, edited by Sayers. 
- In my **Methods** subtopic, consider swapping Drucker's book for the essay, "Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display".
    * Whatever additional gender/queer focused text should probably go in this subtopic as well. 
- In **Networks,** take out *The Exploit* (I already have two other Galloways).
    * move *Protocol* from **Language** to **Networks**. 
- In **Editing, Editions, and Archives**, add McKenzie, D.F., *Bibliography and the Sociology of Texts,* 1999.
- In **Science/Hyper -Fiction**, maybe remove one of the novels. 
- Consider working with Karl Steel, who does Speculative Philosophy and Posthumanism. 
- You should approach these texts as ideas that you can push off of---using one to talk about the other. 
- Think about what questions you're trying to answer with each subtopic. Try to narrow the interest and curiosity down.

***

These suggestions have prompted me down a slightly distracted two days of reading... after which I have made the following decisions:

First, from my **Media** section, I took out *Paper Knowledges* by Gitelman, which I feel a bit guilty about (it seems a fascinating book), but it doesn't directly address my interests in media about *computation* and transcriptions into digital forms... as well as storage and memory and futurity. The remaining books on the list are more important. 

I added a different article by Jacob Gaboury (which he kindly alerted me to in an email), published recently in  *Women and Performance*, to my **Language** section.

Finally, after reading through Laura Mandell's article, which was good, I decided it was too much about big data for my focus. So I will add (instead) an article by Pamela Caughie (et al) on the difficulty of encoding gender ontologies. This will also replace Kenneth Goldsmith's book on *Uncreative Writing*, in my **Editing** subtopic.

## December 3

So now I turn to my digital list, to M--'s question: what do I want to get out of this list?

1) Technology and gender: how technology "reads" or "encodes" gender. How the binairies and abstractions of computation struggle or fail to register the complexity of embodied human experience.

2) The discipline/methods/hermeneutics: how digital methods encourage play and speculation, the role of subjectivity built into criticism that cannot be "corrected" by computation ("distant" reading is just like close reading). Computation and creativity.

3) Technology and the nonverbal/affective: how can technology/digital tools engage nonverbal/preverbal/affective qualities or responses about literature; more pointedly, how do digitization/methods engage *embodied* reading practices?

## November 30

Queer Modernism list:

Need to cut--Theories of Gender, Sexuality and Race AND Queer Affects subtopics to 10 books maximum, and combine them into one master queer theory subtopic. The plus and minuses indicate whether the work has been added or cut from my list. 

Foundations--texts about women's silence/repression in writing?

\+ "Laugh of the Medusa" \
\- *Disidentifications* \
\- *Gender Trouble* (keeping *Bodies that Matter*) 

Prologue--*affects*?

\- Boone, *Libidinal Currents* \
\- Sedgwick, *Touching Feeling* (but keeping chapter on "Shame") \
\- Ahmed, *Queer Phenomenology* & *Promise of Happiness* \
\- Berlant & Edelman, "Sex, or the Unbearable" 

I really don't feel great about a lot of these cuts. There are things that I want to read on here. But I need to remember that I cannot read everything, shouldn't try to read everything, but only to read things that will be relevant to MY project, which cannot be comprehensive. So I've chosen to keep works that have most directly to do with the themes/issues that my project will treat. **What are the major affects related to queerness? What about writing or reading sexuality and gender?** The texts must be able to speak to these questions. 

The final list for Queer Modernisms:

### Foundations
- Rich, Adrienne. "When We Dead Awaken: Writing as Revision", 1979.
- Cixous, Helen. "The Laugh of the Medusa", 1975.

- Sedgwick, Eve Kosofsky. *The Epistemology of the Closet*, 1990.
- Butler, Judith. *Bodies That Matter*, 1993. 

### Affects
- Bersani, Leo. “Is the Rectum a Grave?” 1987.
- Cvetkovich, Ann. *An Archive of Feelings: Trauma, Sexuality, and Lesbian Public Cultures*, 2003.
- Sedgwick, Eve Kosofsky. Chapter on "Shame" from *Touching Feeling: Affect, Pedagogy, Performativity*, 2003.
- Muñoz, José. *Cruising Utopia: The Then and There of Queer Futurity*, 2009.
- Love, Heather. *Feeling Backward: Loss and the Politics of Queer History*, 2009.

### Protomodernist Aestheticizations
- Wilde, Oscar. *The Picture of Dorian Gray*, 1890 and 1891, and MS.
- Pater, Michael. *Studies of the History of the Renaissance*.
- Field, Michael. *Sight and Song*, 1892.

### Modernist Auto/biography and Journals
- Woolf, Virginia. *Orlando*, 1928.
- Woolf, Virginia. *A Writer's Diary*, 1953.
- Woolf, Virginia. "A Sketch of the Past", 1939.
- Stein, Gertrude. "Q.E.D.", 1903 and *Three Lives*, 1909. 
- Barnes, Djuna. *Nightwood*, 1936.
- Mansfield, Katherine and Margaret Scott. *The Katherine Mansfield Notebooks*, 2002.

### Postmodern Memoir-esque

- Baldwin, James. *Giovanni's Room*, 1956.
- Anzaldua, Gloria. *Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza*, 1987.
- Myles, Eileen. *Chelsea Girls*, 1994.

## November 28

Spent some time today cutting down the literary readings for Queer Modernisms: *protomodernism*, *modernist auto/biography*, and *postmodern memoir*. 

The things I CUT:
- Colette, *Pure and the Impure*
- Feinberg, *Stone Butch Blues*
- Delany, *Motion of Light in Water*
- Wittig, *Les Guerilleres*
- Woolf, short stories (from *Monday or Tuesday)
- Stein, *Autobiography of Alice* & *Tender Buttons*
- Nelson, *Bluets* & *Argonauts*

The things I ADDED:
- Stein, *Q.E.D.* & *Three Lives*
- Woolf, "Sketch of the Past"
- Rosenberg, *Confessions of the Fox*

Things that SURVIVED:
- Myles, *Chelsea Girls*
- Baldwin, *Giovanni's Room*
- Mansfield, *Complete Journals*, ed. Margaret Scott

A few notes on some of these decisions:

Concerning Mansfield---I was going to take her out completely (she's about 700 pages long!), but the journal has been such a delight to read (though a slog to carry around). And she's clearly some kind of queer---speaking about women in passionate, consicously sexual terms. There's a vitality to her language (which I've mentioned about her letters(!) and short stories)---a darkness mixed with lightthat I find irresistible. Able to read for 700 pages. Then there's the compelling voice of the editor (transcriber!), Margaret Scott, in the footnotes. She revises John Middleton Murray's previous editorial work (overwriting and censorsop), and her voice comes through in a lovely soft way. 

Stone Butch Blues---This one was difficult to drop. The fear of identification/disidentification---the tension between them---runs strong here. I know that personally this is a book I *have to read*, but intellectually and aesthetically it's not as compelling to me as others which I'd rather keep on my list. It made me cry. It's too raw, not particularly literary. "My stone self". The most unmediated narrative on the list. Is this interesting? Art?

Giovanni's Room---beautifully written first page. Therefore stays.

After cutting down these texts, some things become quite clear. My project is really invested in editing and editorial practices. The footnotes are important. The mediations and fictionalities are important. This is why Woolf's short stories have to go and "Sketch of the Past" takes their place. Why *Stone Butch Blues* has to go, and *Chelsea Girls* must stay. Why Mansfield and Rosenberg are on there, too. (Still unsure about Maggie Nelson, TBH. I do love *Bluets*)

Significantly, this means that I can cut down my secondary reaings to fit this more streamlined focus. 

## November 7

Today I spent a couple of hours cutting down my "Theories of Perception + Mind" list. Got rid of a lot of things that I either didn't want to read or seemed unnecessary. These past couple of weeks have really made me realize that (1) I'm dealing with too many texts and ideas and (2) I already have something solid---a question---that I want to pursue so I don't need to plan for reading to search for a question. 

What is the question? Well, I can't quite phrase it at this point. But it has something to do with how digital tools engage queer affects in a way that is embodied (through the body) which includes the mind; and part of this is an examination of how perception and thinking and feeling work, on a biological level, and how that compares to computational processes---or alterntively, how computational reveal or inform how thinking/feeling/perception work. This list---theories of perception and the mind---is what will guide that latter component. 

So---to try and put it succintly---looking at what computation reveals about perception---perceptual processes and emotions---and seeing how digital tools can engage or play with these connections---specifically in the digitization of queer and autobiographical modes of writing/creativity. Does that help? I'm not sure it does. 

Anyway, to recap the work today, where I got rid of the following subtopics:
- Affect + technology
- Color theory
- Empiricism
- Ecocriticism

The most important texts from these lists have migrated to other subtopics. So the current subtopics include:
- the Posthuman Body
- Vision
- Cognition (and emotion)
- Philosophies of mind + Empiricism
- Speculative Realism
- [and literature... "neuronovels"?]

Major decisions here include fusing "Affect and tech" to the "Posthuman body"; significantly cutting down the contents of Vision + Cognition (*Micrographia* had to go), fusing the Philosophy lists (they really present one trajectory on a question---which is historical and goes from Aristotle to Whitehead), and keeping Speculative Realism (because it's current and extremely interesting to me). There's still the literature section---not sure what will go here. Maybe memoirs about the brain, "neuronovels", as J. Tougaw calls them.

On the bus ride home today I also came to another decision about scheduling and list limits. 
1. Each list will contain a maximum of 25 works. Because I don't want to kill myself.
2. There will be 5 subtopics with an average of 5 books each or 6 subtopics with an average of 4 books each (one subtopic containing 5 books).
3. I will allow myself (assuming the exam is on May 15) 4.5 months (18 weeks) to study. January 7 (monday) to May 15.
4. Given these limits, I will allow 5 books (or one subtopic) per week. One book for each week way. On the weekends I will synthesize the most important points, keeping it short and to the point. One paragraph per book with notes on moments of interest. 
5. Therefore, the schedule allows 5 weeks for each list, and runs accordingly: 
    - Jan 7-Feb 10 (Digital list); 
    - Feb 11-March 17 (Perception/Consciousness); 
    - March 18-April 19 (Queer Mod); 
    - April 22-May 14 (Review); 
    - May 15: exam.

I think this pacing will give me the structure and space that I need in order to do what is necessary. 

## October 30: meeting with W--

*Asking you to be part of my committee...*

“Queer Modernisms” or “queer modernisms and affects”. Contains mostly modernist fiction and journals, postmodern memoir and experimental writing, with some theory on sexuality/race, gender, queer studies.

Topics include:
Theories of Gender, Sexuality, and Race 
Queer Affects
Protomodernism (Wilde, Walter Pater, and Henry James)
Modernist Fiction/Life Writing (Stein, Woolf, Barnes, Isherwood)
Postmodern Memoir (Barthes, Baldwin, Delany, Myles, Bechde)
Experimental Writing / Journals (Mansfield and Woolf… and more)

Methodology is digital (this is my main field of study---digital humanities). I’m interested in the digital insofar as it facilitates new ways of reading, new hermeneutical models based on speculation and play, (possible through computer) but also in difficulty of using technology (which is dominated by logics, computation, abstractions) to engage the complexities and ambiguities of literature.
* Encoding (“tagging” different elements of a text like identity, affect). The difficulty of categorizing or “encoding” queer IDs.
* Textual analysis (using computation to mine for affect / sentiment analysis) Also known as “distant reading”. 
* Processes of digitization and how new formats change the way we read, attuned to previously overlooked qualities about the text.  
* Pedagogical aspect --- teaching close reading --- annotation tools. How can digital annotation engage nonverbal responses to text? What is the role of the nonverbal in learning to close-read?

My questions:
* In what ways do technologies of digitization and mediation facilitate new interpretations or readings?
* What digital tools or methods engage the complexities of queer affect and identity? 
* How can digital methods engage nonverbal or affective responses to reading? (this is a pedagogical question)

W--'s Comments:
* When considering the “Theories of Gender/Sex/Race” and “Queer Affects” list, don’t think too much in binary terms. Don’t have this stark division in my mind, because they aren’t as divided. 
* Restore Adrienne Rich’s two essays from “Rejects”.
* Maybe move Bersani… 
* Some of the lists look a bit short. Consider “Protomodernism”, where you should add Michael Field. 
* Some of the lists can be combined. Like Postmodern Memoir and Experimental Writing. Combine those into “Autobiographical and Experimental Writing”
* Avoid problematic binaries.
* What would be the effect of keeping the “Rejects”, as a kind of silent chorus? 
* Structured reading time. 
* Learning to speak with poise, the complexity about things you are reading. Emphasize the positive parts of this process, not the stress. 
* J. Tougaw’s article about Pedagogy in W--’s class. 
* The last week of classes is an ideal time---definitely before the last day of class. 

***
coming at this a few hours later... I had a revelation on the subway. What if I took seriously W--'s comments about the "Rejects" acting as a chorus (that is, as actors who do not affect the primary action). What if I re-consider the way that I'm organizing this list, with groupings that are *preformative* instead of *descriptive*? To run with the example of Greek plays, I could have a group of texts that form a "prologue", others that represent various "episodes".... or to follow Shakespearean structure, the five parts from "exposition" to "denouement". 

## October 24

Again revisiting QM list. The revelation of doing journals as a focus still has an encouraging effect on me. (though W-- still hasn't written back, which keeps me anxious...).

I'm revising my High Modernist Fiction list to "Modernist Autobiography". It seems to me that many of these works are actually autobiographical, to a certain extent:
- Orlando
- The Autobiography of Alice B Toklas
- Colette
- Nightwood
- Isherwood

There's a thin line between reality and fiction. That these stories draw from life. Others in this list which do not fit so nicely:
- Jacob's Room
- Well of Loneliness
- K. Mansfield's short stories

So what to do about this? Keep them as anomalies? Or maybe... and this excites me... after I'm done delineating all the autobiographical stuff I'll be left with all of these kind of unbelievable and fantastical novels that make up their own genre. The outcasts will form their own classification, their own community, in other words.

This idea of Modernist Autobiography comes to me from Georgia Johnson's Formation of Modernist lesbian Autobiography, which has a helpful introduction. The topic of autobiography is paramount. Because it brings into question the function of identity --writing subjects in relation to the intended audience---something that is always interesting to me. It enhances the role of the speaking "I". The difficulty of categorizing, encoding queer identities.

Question---What hapens when you combine the encoding of queer identity and nonverbal annotion or engaging emotion/affect of the reader?
- how does affect relate to identity?
- how does what I feel when I read relate to the identities embedded in the text?

In the "Torment of Queer Literature", the writer talks about identification through negative emotions---shame, terror, panic, stigma. The fear of reading yourself into the characters. The isolation of doing so. The fear when you encounter a mirror of your pain and suffering. The fear of being represented and not represented. The fear of finding yourself on the page as a marginalized subject.

## October 20

It's been a while. I've been anxious about my Queer Modernisms list. I feel that I really ought to be developing a focus at this point. From what I've been hearing lately, and a perspective that I'm trying to adopt, is that I just need to finish the damn thing. I need to really start conceiving of my dissertation not as an impending revelation but as an imminent project. I need to pursue what I know I already like, what is within my reach.

What do I already like? I like notebooks, journals, histories of composition, speculation, the potentials of form. 

*Histories of composition* (Now I will revise my QM list to reflect this focus.)

Joseph Allen Boone's *Libidinal Currents* --- the affect of close reading.
Csvetkovitch *An Archive of Feelings* --- "acting out" as an archive, as a public act.

Feelings of impending rejection from my desired committee members. I feel fundamentally lost. But also realizing that I'm so much stronger, smarter, have gone futher than I give myself credit for. 

What is within my reach? This interest in journals, in composing. I'm interested in the first draft. The pen against paper, momentum, the errata of daily life, the sunlight against paper. In archives, histories, real stories. 

Question --- in what ways do technologies of digitization and mediation facilitate new interpretations/readings of this kind of work?

I've just removed many works from my Theory, Protomodernism, and High Modernism topcs. Removing novels by James, Cther, which I either haven't read or don't sense that they will be terribly interesting to me. That is to say that I am focusing. Narrowing down. Aiming for things already within my reach; and it feels good.

## July 26

So this is my second day of working on the digital list. So far I have researched three sub-topics: 
* methods --- includes scientific method and digital and digital textuality and theories of reading, hermeneutics
* networks --- internet cables, wireless networks, social media, histories of the internet, cloud, communications and network theory
* language --- hypertext studies, hypertext/cyber fiction, reading/writing on the machine, programming languages and poetics. 

You can see that these topics aren’t very tight. Things get a bit more complex with my media section. There’s a fine line between paper/print/digital formats and then of programming languages. Media I’ll approach more as media archaeology. And as vitality. Though this line of vitality in media also runs through language. I think these distinctions will work themselves out. 

I’m including Caitlin Fisher’s *These Waves of Girls* because I love it and it’s had such a big influence on me / hypertext writing. Wish I could find more works like that one… 

This list is in many ways the one I’m most excited about. It’s foundational. The ideas are the reason that I’ve wanted to study literature at the PhD level. 

Books like Galloway’s *Protocol* or Ramsay’s *Reading Machines* excite me like no other. There is so much potential to be had. A whole terrain of feeling that underlies the way we use technology and the books that we read. My dissertation aims to uncover these embedded feelings. Not that they are hiding (*not* a hermeneutics of suspicion) but that the are there, waiting to be felt, if only one can approach them from a position of ignorance, defamiliarization, speculation. A hermeneutics of wonder… A speculative method.

## July 24

Back at this. 

Last week (yesterday) I finished (sort of) my Queer Modernisms list. So far, it feels much less coherent than the theories of perception. I have two main categories of criticism --- sex, gender, and race & queer affects/temporalities. But then things become more eclectic. The literature is divided into four categories:

* Protomodernism --- Pater, Wilde, James, and Vernon Lee? 
* Modernism --- Woolf, Barnes, Stein, Mansfield, Isherwood!, Hall, Colette
* Postmodernism --- Baldwin?, Feinburg?, Highsmith, Waters (things are getting very eclectic)
* Experimental Writing / Autobio / Manus --- Mansfield, Woolf, Delany, Bechdel, Myles… 

I want to trace affects in queer writing. I want to use technology to trace affects in queer writing. 

Many of these books are sad, depressing, but that’s a major part of being queer! There’s also the anger. There’s also the sense of being out of time. 

I think I need to step up my memoir game. 

Now I actually feel better about this. My queer modernisms list is all about feeling queer --- what it means to feel queer. How we can examine/exhume new ways of being queer?

I need to look at more notebooks. I also need to add more visual memoir and life writing. 

## July 15

Today I took it a little easy. I worked on my Queer Affects list. Though I’m changing the title to Queer Affects and Time. Not only are the common topics among the works, but I also think that they are means of connection or vitality in queer writing. 

So one of the problems is distinguishing this list from the Sex, Gender, and Race list alongside it. Right now I’m conceiving the break as temporal. That is, that many of the arguments and texts actually belong in Sex, Gender, Race but that there was a development of thought more toward emotion, affect, time. So that’s one way of distinguishing them. That Affect Theory is a natural or logical outgrowth of feminist critique, of queer critique. I know nothing about queerness. Or affect. I really need to spend more time reading criticism on it. 

## July 13

The Queer Modernisms list is going well. I’ve set a scheme for topics:

* Theories of gender, sexuality, race
* Queer Affects
* Fiction (incl protomodernist, high modernist, post modern, autobio & experimental writing
* Journals / Diaries / manuscripts
* Womens’ writing theories

This gives me a bit of anxiety, but I think it will go well. Today I honed down “theories” and tomorrow I will do “affects”. I think I need a whole week---next week---to shape the “fiction” section, and journals/diaries/manus.

## July 11

Day three of my Queer Modernisms list. And I don’t feel as if I’ve accomplished enough. Still in the stage of assembling and collecting readings, adding things that I’ll have to vet later, probably too much and it’s too early to see what kind of shape it will take. 

There are a few categories that I’m sure of:

* Queer Theory --- includes some race, futurity, as well as greatest hits like Foucault, Butler, Halberstam, etc.
* Fiction --- Decadence (Wilde, Rachilde, Fields?); High Modernism (Woolf, Barnes, Stein, Mansfield, Cather?); Postmodernism (Baldwin?, Delany?, Moraga?)
* Autobiography --- Delany, Bechdel, Myles, Edmund White, Barthes, Colette?, Anzaldua
* Lesbian pulp / classics ?
* Women Writers Criticism --- Shari Benstock
* Literary Theory ?

Maybe my postmodern list can be specified as “postmodern autobiography” or “memoir” or “life writing”.

I’m really only interested in modernist *fiction* and postmodern *nonfiction* or *memoir*. Woolf’s Orlando being the fulcrum between those two. This idea actually really excites me. Maybe I can also include Wilde and Rachilde into the modern… though this would destroy the woman focus. 

As I was reading *Well of Loneliness* today I also had another thought about the distinction between genres---specifically the realist versus the stream of consciousness. Maybe I need to have some kind of criticism on these styles. Because they seem very important. The whole topic of comparative genres seems like it will be crucial to my work. 

## July 9 

So, after a weekend break, today I’ve started on a new list, Queer Modernisms. There will be three major areas:
* Queer Theory
* Queer Fiction
* Queer Autobiography / Journals / Lifewriting in general

Chronologically, it spans from Oscar Wilde to Alison Bechdel. It’s concerned with sexuality, desire, affect, networks, visuality, feminism, and theories of the archives, composition and writing the self. 

I don’t have anything as specific as a rationale, yet. But there are a couple of things I do know and that I can say at this point. 

First is that not all the authors are “queer”. Katherine Mansfield for example. So I’m going to have to redefine “Queer” as something more expansive. The same sex thing is very important. But I think that being *queer* has more to do with an aesthetics or a mode of feeling. (Mansfield is absolutely vital. She brims. She’s ripe for a speculative realist reading. In my view, if Woolf belongs on the list, so does Mansfield. So what is “queer”? It’s a way of feeling…)

Second. I’m not sure about the role that notebooks/autobiography plays against fiction. This is something that will have to be worked out more deliberately. I’m interested in drafts, in looking at histories of textuality and composition practices. So that somehow needs to work its way onto the list. The trace of a piece of writing, the different versions of that piece of writing. Should it really be differentiated from the final piece? Should they be listed together, and separated by other categories besides its “state”? The journals/letters/diaries/autobiographies seem unnecessary to separate. That’s what I’ll do for now. But I’ll continue to think about the interplay.

**Concerning the issue of too many works:**

**Concerning the issue with topics/organization:** 
* Coming at this in retrospect, I think the general “areas” of perception (vision, body, cognition) should get their own topics and then the specific movements (speculative realism, posthuman, empiricism) will also get their own topics. To me, that makes the most sense, because I am interested in perception and also what various trends/groups have to say about it). 

**Concerning the issue of stakes:**

**Concerning the issue of research questions:**

## July 5 2018

Starting to feel a bit overwhelmed with how the list is going. I think it’s too much, too many works and divergent topics. I’m not sure the topics cohere. Let me try to sketch them:

Perception ----> Cognition - Vision - Color Theory - Visual Studies - Affect Theory
Philosophical -----> Speculative Realism - Philosophy of Mind - Empiricism - The Posthuman - Literary theory (or language)

It seems like Affect Theory belongs in Perception, though it could also belong in Philosophical traditions, I’m not sure. A similar difficulty with the posthuman, or maybe not. 

(reflecting on this in the future, I think the list is divided into topics that more immediately study perception and topics that study more established fields that study perception.)

Affect and Posthuman are both very contemporary fields. But if I were to arrange this chronologically that would make no sense. Many of these topics are already driven or organized around chronological considerations. In any case, if I were to do that, I would have something like, “Contemporary Fields of Perception” or “Feeling in the Tech-Age”.

One thing is for sure. There is a body of scientific discourse, and another of philosophical (and then of cultural (visual studies). 

## July 4 2018

Yesterday I read review for books on the topic “Bodies and Technology / Posthuman / Forgetting the Physical”, including especially work by Donna Haraway, Katherine N Hayles, and some Cyberfeminism. I originally created this topic because, just like I have sections on “vision” and “cognition”, I thought I should have one on bodies. But, as I was populating it, I realized that it’s mostly to do with feminist approaches that question the method of scientific and technological discourse. What I thought was more about feeling/affect actually turns out to be about methodology… Or at least very much entwined with discourse in scientific inquiry. Are Haraway and Hayles more about correcting historical notions or about proposing new notions--- “putting the body back in”? Brian Massumi, who is also on this list, has a stake in critical discourse as well. He’s against structuralism, like Haraway and Hayles criticize enlightenment/modernity. So I guess they do, after all, engage. Bodies & Discourse on Bodies. 

Today I worked on my “vision” section, which actually mutated into two sections: “visual studies” and “color theory”. Visual studies contains historical perspectives on vision, and how vision is connected/constructed by culture. This list includes mostly WJT Mitchell, Jonathan Crary, Johanna Drucker. But it also will include some more historical tracts and secondary overviews of the history of vision, such as “Micrographia” by Robert Hooke. What I want is to get a kind of trajectory for how ideas about vision and how vision worked evolved through history and for more contemporary accounts of how modernity relates to visual culture. For the color theory list I have Newton, Goethe, and Wittgenstein. Here I’m really just interested in tracing their trans-historical debate, to follow the trends and the discourse. To get an up close idea of how people debated vision and color. This is as much about discourse/method as it is about optics. 

## July 2 2018

Today I did some research on Alfred North Whitehead, the Speculative Realists, and I began my “technofeminism” list that I will complete tomorrow. I also read “Bliss” by Katherine Mansfield. 

The field of Speculative Realism is heavily dominated by men---all the articles in *Speculations* and *Collapse* that I could find. I think there’s an opportunity for a feminist perspective, or to frame the Speculative Realist insight---process philosophy--- knowing things in themselves---as a queer intervention. 

Speaking of queer interventions, there are a lot of stakes flying around in my mind. 
The stakes are:
* teaching --- pedagogy --- how can we enhance this with technology? (something I’m trying to achieve with my ITP work, which is essentially about how technology engages affect to enhance teaching)
* feminist/queer --- not quite sure what my question is here --- maybe it’s something about engaging absent queerness in literature? Creating or describing (absent, latent, apparent) networks of queerness? Networks of feeling that are queer? (I’m saying all of this and I’m aware that it falls under the hermeneutics of suspicion. I don’t want to be suspicious. I want to revel in the feeling.)
* the method --- the methodology must be speculative. It must mix criticism with creativity in some way. It must---in Jerome McGann’s words---allow us to “imagine what we don’t know”. 

I think now, in reflection that these three concerns form the seeds of each of my lists.
*the means will be digital, the methodology will be speculative*
*the focus or target will be the feeling, affect*
*the content will be queer---queer lives, queer feelings*

## June 30 2018

Today and yesterday I have been reading book reviews for various works in cognitive studies and neuroscience. These books will form one subsection of my list--- “theories of perception and philosophies of mind”. 

I’m interested in this topic because I think it will allow me to bridge feeling/affect and technology. How does technology affect the way we feel? In particular, I’m interested in *how the digital can stimulate new feelings about literature*. That is actually very broad, not particular at all. 

There are some practical questions:
* How can we build tools that engage feeling, affect, during the reading process?
* And, turning from the reader’s side of things, and toward the writer’s, how can we use text analysis to mine feeling in the words, phrases, syntax, format itself?

Texts are networks waiting to be mapped. There is an ecology of feeling, affect, emotion in all this writing.

So I guess that this entry is just to say that studying the brain and cognitive processes will help me to better understand how feeling happens in the mind and the feeling mind’s connection/stimulation by technology. 

This all seems very ambitious.
