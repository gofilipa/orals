| The **Explanatory Gap**, Tougaw: how the physical processes of the brain cannot explain the immaterial experience of consciousness | The gap between the **formal and the forensic materiality** in computational media (Kirschenbaum), the formal (screens and displays) occluding the inscriptions of the forensic (traces on the hard drive). | Computation and consciousness both engage in this tension between the material and the immaterial, about what we can see/touch without fully knowing how it works. |
| **Neurons**, Damasio: large charge differences between inside and outside that depolarize and an electrical impulse is released down the axon like a wave. | The Central Prodessing Unit (CPU) is built by placing billions of microscopic **transistors** onto a single computer chip. Those transistors are amplifiers or switches for electrical charges, patterns of them make calculations. | At the most basic level of thinking/feeling and computation, computers and brains run on electric charges that fire. |  
| LeDoux’s concept of **working memory** consists of a temporary storage system (the workspace) and a control system (memory) that performs executive functions. According to Damasio, the way that this process of **recall** works is by a formula which the brain stores to retrieve certain information. When the person is making a recollection, they are re-stimulating sensory maps in the brain indicated by the formula formula. | **Hard Drive and Random Access Memory**: HD is used for long term storage, and RAM for holding information currently being used. This model is just like Working Memory, where there is a workspace and storage space. In addition, programming is **code that executes**---it does something---and computers store everything in file directories. For example, if/then statements in javascript, and file paths (XPATH and DOM) to locate and retrieve code. | This bears out Bergson’s question about how we access memories---a combination of storage and execution that resembles how computer code works in executing commands and navigating through file directories. We might imagine the brain as a large file system that is accessed by certain codes.|
| The **Letterbox**, Dahaene: Area in the occipital lobe for decoding words and letters, which filter up through the temporal/parietal lobes toward meaning making. | The passage of the **Fractured Sign** (Tenen) occludes the textual conduit. What originates from (1) the keyboard as the mechanical action of a switch becomes (2) an electric signal that (3) leaves electromagnetic marks in computer memory, which (4) morph into phases of liquid crystal on-screen, leaving behind (5) letters that emanate outward as light. | Suggests that word processing includes several ongoing computations occurring simultaneously, beyond our awareness. |
| **Mirror Neurons**, Pitts-Taylor: In creating vicarious states of action/feeling in the observer, mirror neurons project our own assumptions onto others. There are limits to identification---mirror neurons make misreadings. | Hayles’s **Flickering Signifiers**: the connection between computer keys and text manipulation is nonproportional and electronic---A model of signification in which no simple one-to-one correspondence exists between signifier and signified. | Words are unstable, misreading is inevitable---we would benefit from embracing this instability (Tougaw). |
