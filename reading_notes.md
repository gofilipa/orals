## Digital Methods and Textualitites

### Methods 

Moretti, Franco. *Graphs, Maps, Trees: Abstract Models for Literary History*. 2007. Print.
- Moretti supports a positivist agenda for literary criticism. He ascribes an objective status to visualizations, as if they aren’t based on subjective research (monographs!) and his own decision making. He also neglects to fully embrace his own readings as subjective, and calls them “explanations” rather than “interpretations”. 
- Basically, Moretti minimizes his role as a critic, in service of a larger, collective project on doing literary history. But he doesn’t have to minimize the critic’s reading to feel like he’s part of a collective. 

Drucker, Johanna. "Introduction," *SpecLab: Digital Aesthetics and Projects in Speculative Computing*. 2009. PDF.
- Drucker uses the computer for creative ends. Computation geared toward speculation rather than testing or confirmation. 
- Doesn’t this line of argument perpetuate the idea that the computer is more objective than the human? That the computer ultimately remains a rational tool? Isn’t it just pointing the direction of interpretation at a new target, which is speculation, while still using the same gun? Is this right?
- How would speculation and potentiality play into a feminist project/reading?

Ramsay, Stephen. *Reading Machines: Toward an Algorithmic Criticism*. 2011. Print.
- Ramsay positions himself as a moderate, saying that computers are merely tools, part of a more expansive subjective process, of hermeneutics. His ideas herer agree nicely with Drucker’s in Speclab. 
- What’s particularly useful about Ramsay is his opposing of humanistic endeavor against scientific inquiry. This specifies how observation is a phenomenal, subjective experience, and is antithetical to the motives and processes of scientific inquiry, the scientific method. Ramsay allows us to understand how empirics(?) can be subsumed within a humanistic frame, which does not attempt to ascertain “truth” but only “potentiality”. 
- Like Drucker, isn't Ramsay speaks as if the computer is this uber-objective tool? Like code/software has no biases or idiosyncrasies? What about examining the way that these processes encode subjectivity? 

Drucker, Johanna. "Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display." *DHQ: Digital Humanities Quarterly*. 2011. Web.
- Drucker argues that data visualization tools and techniques naturalize and flatten things that are actually complex and ambiguous. She proposes that we switch “data” (given) for “capta” (taken), to emphasize how all information has been constructed, pre-cooked (never raw). She proposes that we skew and blur and disrupt the neatness of our graphs and charts. 
- But isn’t this just turning criticism into poetry? Don’t we need something stronger, clearer,more delineated?
- What is the role is clarity and “realist” or “natural” constructions of knowledge?

Felski, Rita. *The Limits of Critique.* 2015. PDF.
- Felski usefully talks about reading as an affective orientation. It’s not about the way that we read, but about the way that we position ourselves and our desires around texts. She warns that suspicious attitudes toward texts foreclose the possibility for new readings, new thoughts. 

Piper, Andrew. *Enumerations: Data and Literary Study*, 2018. Print.
- This shows how distant and close reading can be used together --- Distant reading provides context, or framework, for close reading; in which number becomes a lens, a frame of the quantitative, to approach closer readings and even inform further model building. 
- Though computation facilitates literary analysis, a number of flawed premises about distance, bigness, or objectivity (which lack a science of generalization), have clouded the ways we approach computation (9).
    - “Entanglement is a far more appropriate way of thinking about literary modeling than the disembodied eye in the sky of the lone, distant reader” (19).
        - By incorporating models/graphs/visualizations, “We are no longer using our own judgments as benchmarks... but explicitly constructing the context through which something is seen as significant (and the means through which significance is assessed).... It interweaves subjectivity with objects” (17). 
- With Machine Learning, engages a speculative method: “We see how “feeling” is gradually redefined over time by the novel away from an emotional state to one of perceptual encounter. This sense of the contemporary novel’s investment in sensorial embodiment awaits fuller treatment” (117). 

### Networks

Galloway, Alexander. *Protocol*, 2004. PDF.
- Codes that append all data…controlling power lies in the technical protocols that make network connections possible. “The acceptance of universal standardization in order to facilitate the freer and more democratic medium” (147).
- The flexibility promoted by a control society is actually used to exercise control, requiring autonomous submission. Resistance to this kind of control consists of finding loopholes or “exploits” in systems (what hackers do).
- DNS and TCP/IP engage a vertical (hierarchical) and horizontal (democratic) models of control, with the effect of submitting the “freedom” of movement in the network to the authorization of a controlling head. This paradox between freedom and control, between hierarchy and horizontalism, can perhaps help us to transcend our thinking of computers as disambiguation machines. 
- A protocol is a wrapper---it does not engage in meaning/content, but in possibility, physics or logic. Thinking of protocols as tags that are appended, added on, not changing the data but wrapping it, with possibility. There is a speculative component here. This is about the EXPLOIT.
- “Protocol is a circuit, not a sentence” (52).
- Code is the only language that is executable. It acts out its inscriptions, that it applies to something… Code does what it says, it goes from declaration to movement. Code has a semantic meaning, but it also has an enactment of meaning. It moves. 
    - “Code thus purports to be multidimensional. Code draws a line between what is material and what is active, in essence saying that writing (hardware) cannot do anything, but must be transformed into code (software) to be effective… The algorithm is prepared in advance, then later executed by the artist” (165). 

Chun, Wendy, *Control and Freedom: Power and Paranoia in the Age of Fiber Optics,* 2006. Print.
- How hardware (as opposed to software) engages with the freedom/control paradox of internet networks. 
- To Chun, the issue isn’t the control technologies that drive the internet, but in the way that the workings of the technology is obscured, the ways that protocol is hidden and amplified. We aren’t aware of the packets that pass through our computer, but they are there. “If you believe that your communications are private, it is because software corporations, as they relentlessly code and circulate you, tell you that you are behind, and not in front of, the window” (22)
- All computers engage in this give and take. That’s what make networks possible in the first place. Napster just made this fundamental truth evident.
- The internet’s potential is not in individual empowerment, but in universal exposure, in the way that it exposes us to new visibilities that we cannot control. 
- What are the possibilities opened up by our vulnerabilities?

Bennett, Jane. *Vibrant Matter: A Political Ecology of Things*, 2010. PDF.
- Vitality means that things have their own forces, trajectories, tendencies. 
Thinking of matter as an object or dead makes us destructive; we assert our power/subjectivity over them rather than acknowledge a mutual connection. 
Objectifying something is harmful for us and for them. 
- Rather than be suspicious (hermeneutics of suspicion), which projects an agential/subjective presence, we ought to dwell in a hermeneutics of wonder, of knowing things through intellectual and aesthetic exercises, which motivate fascination (action?) rather than critique. 
- Everything is really an assemblage. Your brain is not “you”, but a collection of processes that are engaging with a bunch of other processes to form “you”. This is the connection to the swarm. A bunch of things are vitalized, and therefore acting in tandem like a swarm. 

Moten, Fred and Stefano Harney. *The Undercommons: Fugitive Planning & Black Study*, 2013. Epub.
- The university is dedicated to re-producing and perpetuating the oppressive and hierarchical orders of society. This cannot be overcome, so one ought to sneak into the university and steal what one can. You can be in but not of the university. 
- How can one be inside of the system and yet resist the system? We can do it by forging connections that are outside of the established “connections”. In other words, by stealing, by feeling each other, by collecting debt, never paying it off, by collective study.  
    - "The undercommons is a fugitive network where a commitment to abolition and collectivity prevails over a university culture bent on creating socially isolated individuals whose academic skepticism and claims of objectivity leave the world as it is intact.” 
- We are broken, but cannot be repaired. All we can do is study, collect debt, and join in the shipped. Study is a mode of thinking with others, an assemblage. Debt is a state of being that we acknowledge but do not attempt to have repaired. We are always building debt, never paying it off. The shipped is where we all are, thrown in together, touching each other, feeling through each other, each other’s feels. 

Tufekci, Zeynep. *Twitter and Tear Gas: the Power and Fragility of Networked Protest*, 2017. PDF.
- Analyzing modern protest and how they use networks to mobilize. She describes how the internet helped the Zapatista uprisings in Mexico, the necessity of remote Twitter users to organize medical supplies during Arab Spring, the refusal to use bullhorns in the Occupy Movement that started in New York.
- There is inherent capacity (practical capacity) and signal capacity (potential capacity), such as promises and threats. Occupy vs SOPA/PIPA. 
- While adhocracy, facilitated by horizontalism, allows for movements to improvise to meet immediate needs, tactical freeze is a potential disruption, an inability to advocate for policies or demands, moves requiring consensus and organization that is antithetical to the horizontal and improvisational structure of adhocracy.  
In such an environment, information and misinformation glut is a real problem, as the important information gets diluted or obscured. Today, gatekeeping is done by governments, algorithms, platforms.

Gaboury, Jacob. ["Becoming NULL: Queer Relations in the Excluded Middle."](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0740770X.2018.1473986) *Women & Performance: a Journal of Feminist Theory*. 28:2, 2018. pp. 143-158. Web.
- Facebook doesn’t care how you identify, but only that your identification is addressable by them. “The move by Facebook allowing for the selection of multiple genders “remain[s] deeply tied to a kind of binary logic, or at the very least a digital one. Put simply, while Facebook gave users more gender options with which to identify, they were still engaging in an act of identification... Here the user has simply been conscripted into enacting the labor of identification once reserved for sophisticated algorithms” (1).
- New systems enact compulsory identification, they do not care how you identify, they only care that you have an identification that is addressable by them. So, What are queer modes of being within technological systems, modes that refuse the gesture of capture and extraction?
- The NULL marker in SQL offers a way of becoming that enacts a queer logic that is explicitly situated within the logic of information systems but refuses this gesture of capture and extraction. A “refusal to cohere, to become legible.” “The use of NULL thus marks an indeterminate mode of being that is at once within and outside, part of and illegible to a discrete system of relations, a “middle” that explicitly marks an indeterminate, incalculable, unknown state of being” (11).

### Language

Barthes, Roland. *S/Z*, 1970. Print.
- Barthes creates a sort of encoding scheme (interpreting according to a series of codes, which create a constellation of meanings across a single text) for Sarrasine. This encoding scheme dramatically opens up meaning, exposes the writerly potential of the text.

Landow, George. *Hypertext 3.0: Critical Theory and New Media in an Era of Globalization*, 2006. Print.
- The hypertext format engages the postmodern (structuralist/post-structuralist and deconstructive) theories about the multiplicity and instability of meaning in texts, as well as new radical conceptions of authorship
- The hypertext is postmodern; hypertext destabilizes the apparently stable, it creates new centers, new tangents, new connections in between textual elements. 

Tenen, Dennis. *Plain Text: the Poetics of Computation*, 2017. Epub.
- Points out that each digital text carries with it a layer of hidden information that determines the display and dissemination of the document. Argues that we need to examine this layer to see how they also determine the way we engage with and interpret the document. There are underlying structures of power in copyright, surveillance, sharing, and modifying text, which is visible only in plain text. 
    - Such media turns us into consumers rather than producers of media. Text that is highly restricted in its encoding threatens our critical ability. 
        - Tenen proposes a microanalysis, computational poetics, or an archaeology of platforms and infrastructures (behind surface content). He points out what elides our notice about these media---that signs are fractured from their inscription (we do not experience how the sign is processed by the computer); and that mediation between human and machine becomes less and less accessible (eventually, we will be able to navigate interfaces with our minds). We don’t engage directly with the textual conduit, so we need to perform a media archaeology in order to have access to these processes and be in charge of them. 
- Shows one cynical consequence of Landow’s argument. Instead of opening up the meaning of the text, of its dynamicity inviting more interpretations, Tenen points out that dynamicity can actually impose restrictions on interpretation. The text on the screen actually hides the ways in which it is already determined. 
- Another interesting complication with the question of affect. Here, Tenen points out how pleasure in reading can actually be a bad thing, can evacuate the critical processes of interpretation. 
    → on the one hand, we have the pleasure of intuitive interfaces and on the other, a short circuiting of critical ability. How does the collapsing/obscuring of mediation between us and our texts affect the way we read them? 

Fisher, Caitlin. *These Waves of Girls*, 2001. Web.
- The profusion of hyperlinks frustrates the reader by offering too many narrative paths. The reader’s frustration in navigating through the hypertext relates to the work’s theme of sexual discovery. In following the narrator as she develops her sexuality, the reader experiences her own cycles of desire and frustration. 
- The reader’s narrative path parallels the theme of sexual discovery.
Additionally, the reader’s narrative desire for closure is related to her sexual desire for release. Narrative/sexual desire conflation. 
    - The desire to write is the desire to fool you, seduce you.”
- The links are associative, they elaborate the linked terms by leading to a single lexia or to another narrative. They can illuminate, echo, or answer another link or lexia. Sometimes we end up in the middle of another narrative. Sometimes we circle back to the same lexia. 
    - FOR example, within the “I have always engaged with impossible comparisons” we click through the arrows to a lexia, “at seven,” which has a link, they'd put their hands on my thigh at the movies, which in fact leads to “Grade two,” another story about the time that an a man fondled the Tracey’s leg at the movies. We have a series of options on this story, and I click the link “the theatre was so dark,” which leads me to a recollection of a night picking fireflies. I click through the arrows, reading through Tracey’s fond and precious memory. The final lexia in this series has a link, “Do they dream about little girls the way I dream about them?” It seems to be referring to the older man (not the fireflies).
- We are always losing context. We read fragments of what was previously written. There is no guidance, the reader decides how to move at every point. It’s all about agency.

Rockwell, Geoffrey and Stefan Sinclair. *Voyant-Tools*. 2018. Web.
- Voyant Tools is a web application, developed out of earlier iterations by Stéfan Sinclair (McGill University) and Geoffrey Rockwell (University of Alberta). It functions as a one-stop-shop for text analysis, offering an easy to use interface that processes text in seconds, organizing it into a series of interactive  lists, charts, graphs, and networks. 
- facilitates:
    - *Praxis as an Hermeneutic* -- The tool’s primary interface on the homepage obscures its documentation to prioritize experimentation over discourse. The blank text box, accompanied by the mysterious “Reveal” button, prompts exploration, where users are invited to jump in without fully knowing how the tool functions, foregrounding the role that ignorance plays in discovering unforeseen elements about the text. 
    - *Speculation* -- Using text-analysis in this way inspires new readings by bringing to light neglected, miniscule, or concealed aspects about texts. The defamiliarization of what we think we know leads us to speculate about other possibilities, and experience more active and playful approaches to inquiry.

### Media

Kittler, Friedrich. *Gramophone, Film, Typewriter*, 1999. Print and PDF.
Asks what if media determined our thought? 
- Whereas, before the 20th century, media passed through symbolism (written signifier), now it is stored as physical traces in sound waves and light. Soon though, all media will lose its specificity, will become streams of numbers, reduced to surface effects (the interface). 
- For electronic writing specifically, this evacuates the necessity for “hallucination”: 
    - “As long as the book was responsible for all serial data flows, words quivered with sensuality and memory. It was the passion of all reading to hallucinate meaning between lines and letters… once memories and dreams, the dead and ghosts, became technically reproducible, readers and writers no longer needed the powers of hallucination” (10).
- Tells us to find pleasure in the circuits:    
    - “What remains is what media can store and communicate. What counts are not the messages or the content with which they equip so-called souls for the duration of a technological era, but rather (and in strict accordance with McLuhan) their circuits, the very schematism of perceptibility. Whosoever is able to hear or see the circuits in the synthesized sound of CDs or in the laser storms of a disco finds happiness” (xl-xli).
- We had no way to record orality---which is prior to writing---until after the “monopoly of writing” had ended. Current and prior sense perceptions elided by present technology may in the future come to be recorded and felt. So this opens up possibilities for fiber optics. 
    - “What will soon end in the monopoly of bits and fiber optics began with the monopoly of writing” (4). What will come of the monopoly of bits and fiber?

Hayles, N. Katherine. *Writing Machines*, 2002. PDF.
- Remediation --- the idea that media is re-conceived or re-written for electronic formats. The “recycling” of different media formats through electronic media (Bolter and Grusin). 
- Technotexts are literary works that self-reflexively engage with their own inscription practices. They explore how many levels of text entwine with bodies, a distributed cognitive environment in which reading takes place. 
- How mediation affects subjectivity, how the interaction between physical and verbal forms construct meaning and therefore, the user/reader. 
- In *House of Leaves*, the remediated narrator evacuates consciousness as the source of production and replaces it with mediated subjectivities. “Consciousness is no longer the relevant frame but rather consciousness fused with technologies of inscription” (116-117).

Kirschenbaum, Matthew. *Mechanisms: New Media and the Forensic Imagination*, 2012. Print.
- Argues for the heterogeneity of digital data---against the idea that they are transient, uniform, copyable, permanent. This combats “screen essentialism”---the idea that what happens on the screen is independent from hardware. It also resists the notion that digital media are totally different from analogue. In fact, a hard drive and a turntable appear and function with striking similarities. 
- Two models --- forensic and formal materiality --- to assess different levels --- physical, logical, and conceptual --- in media. 
    - Forensic Materiality --- the physical world, including the immaterial or virtual (things too small to see). Formal Materiality --- display and appearance, where there is an illusion of immaterial behavior. 
    - “Whereas forensic materiality rests upon the potential for individualization inherent in matter, a digital environment is an abstract projection supported and sustained by its capacity to propagate the illusion (or call it a working model) of immaterial behavior: identification without ambiguity, transmission without loss, repetition without originality” (11).
- The BIT is a symbol of magnetic encoding. It is machine language made human readable; as if humans were to represent sound to an alien who could not hear by writing down phonemes. 
    - The bit is inaccessible to us except in the symbol. This is really the ground zero of … mediation?
- How does RAM, which emerged due to an addressing problem, operate like human memory?
- Operating Systems exist to obscure the act of inscription, first behind a command line, and now behind GUIs. Everything appears evanescent. 

Hansen, Mark. *Feed-Forward: On The Future of 21st Century Media*, 2014. Epub.
- Media in the 21st century largely work outside of our perceptual consciousness but nonetheless inflect our sensations. Technology expands and marginalizes human perceptions. This creates a situation of feed-forward, where consciousness can only pre-engineer its own emergent or just-to-come experiences. Perception is never in the now. 
- “Atmospheric media”; “Worldly capacity for self-sensing”; “environmental sensibility”
- “At one and the same time, 21stC media broker human access to a domain of sensibility that has remained largely invisible (though certainly not inoperative) until now, and, it adds to this domain of sensibility since very individual act of access is itself a new datum of sensation that will expand the world incrementally but in a way that intensifies worldly sensibility” (6, emphasis original)
- Because our perceptual reach is expanded through media, consciousness is always anticipating. 

Woolf, Virginia. "Comparing Marks: A Versioning Edition of Virginia Woolf's 'The Mark on the Wall.'" eds. Emily McGinn, Amy Leggette, Matthew Hannah, and Paul Bellew. *Scholarly Editing: The Annual of the Association for Documentary Editing*, Vol. 35, 2014. Web.
- Hansen’s central intervention on Whitehead’s thought, arguing that, while technology expands the scope for human perception across new sensory environments, it also limits the human’s immediate sensory experience of the world. Mark Hansen offers a provocative framework for thinking about human engagement with twenty-first-century media. It is precisely this exchange between direct and indirect perception that changes my reading of Woolf’s short story. First, on a material level, the edition expands the reader’s access to the text across time, while marginalizing her direct engagement with the witnesses as physical, time-bound objects, as actual books. This tension between the physical and virtual in the edition provokes a further implication on the level of narrative, which complicates Matz’s reading of perceptual unities that drive the narration. Allowing us to expand our perceptual capacities to things we might not directly feel but nonetheless experience, the edition opens up a reading of time as an agent in the story.
- In contrast to the beginning of the story, which locates the action in the past, the interruption here locates the narration in the present, unfolding action, which then leads to a final statement in the past tense. These ambiguities and mergings signal the important role that time plays in mediating the story itself, and especially, in bringing it to a close.

Klein, Lauren F., "The Image of Absence: Archival Silence, Data Visualization, and James Hemings," in *American Literature*, 85 (4): 661–688, 2013. Web.
- The way that Klein approaches her work with the invisible or forgotten is useful here. It’s not about recovering what is absent, of making things present in some way. It’s about tracing the activity, the pathways of connection, networks of communication. 
- “The archive as a site of action rather than as a record of fixity or loss” (665).
- We let ghosts be ghosts. An image of absence. 
- Critique of Ramsay --- there are places where meaning and understanding are impossible. The digital is not just about supplementing subjective hermeneutics with shiny new tools, but about changing the way that we think about the archive, and our understanding of the archival record. 

### Editing

Tanselle, Thomas. "A Rationale of Textual Criticism", 1992. PDF.
- Greg-Bowers-Tanselle are against the tyranny of the copy-text, and think we should be making eclectic editions, being careful and deliberate about our choice and judgment of substantive elements. 
- The textual object is merely a vessel for the text, which is necessarily corrupted in its physical form. 
    - “Those who believe that they can analyze a literary work without questioning the constitution of a particular written or oral text of it are behaving as if the work were directly accessible on paper or in sound waves. … [In fact,] its medium is neither visual nor auditory. The medium of literature is the words (whether already existent or newly created) of a language; and arrangements of words according to the syntax of some language (along with such aids to their interpretation as pauses or punctuation) can exist in the mind, whether or not they are reported by voice or in writing” (16-17).
- His attention to medium of words and paper elides medium of thought---as if the mind is pure thought, not an embodied process. 
- The way he presents the central dilemma of textual criticism----either we pass down what we receive or we correct it---is ultimately conservative and oppressive. How do we maintain without perpetuating? Or recover without overwriting or determining? In other words, how can we open rather than constrain or delimit meaning?

Derrida, Jacques. “Archive Fever: A Freudian Impression.” *Diacritics*, vol. 25, no. 2, 1995. PDF.
- The archive is associated with order and beginnings. Commencement and commandment. Arche, Arke.
- In creating the archive, we open the potential to forget. The externalization of knowledge exposes it to destruction. The archive works against itself.
- The archivization produces as much as it records the event. 
- Technology determines the impression: “It conditions not only the form or the structure which prints, but the printed content of the printing: the pressure of the printing, the impression, before the division between the printed and the printer” (18). 
    - This is the moment proper to the archive. The instant of archivization. “The prosthetic experience of the technical substrate” (22). The impression. 

McKenzie, D.F. *Bibliography and the Sociology of Texts*, 1999. Print.
- McKenzie expands what is admissible. Bibliography is about the social process of transmission. He critiques positivism of bibliographic methods which are analytical or descriptive, which aim to resolve questions of authorial intention or describe physical features. He says we need to promote new knowledge. We need a history of misreading:
    - “Any history of the book---subject as books are to typographic and material change---must be a history of misreadings. This is not so strange as it might sound. Every society rewrites its past, every reader rewrites its texts, and if they have any continuing life at all, at some point every printer redesigns them” (25).
- The tree structure, the trunk being the ideal text (never realized, only hinted at), and the branches being the florid witnesses. The book is never a single object, but a product of a number of human agencies and mechanical techniques that are historically situated. The trunk is the source, the animating principle (the “text”) that flows into the branches, witnesses. All these witnesses imply an ideal form never fully realized. 

McGann, Jerome. *Radiant Textuality: Literature after the World Wide Web*, 2001. Print.
- McGann introduces the term “quantum poetics” to indicate the volatile potentiality for meaning contained in every element of a literary text. He explains that: 
    - “Aesthetic space is organized like quantum space, where the ‘identity’ of the elements making up the space are perceived to shift and change, even reverse themselves, when measures of attention move across discrete quantum levels” (184). 
- IOW, the meaning of particular words in a literary text depends upon a multitude of factors, from antecedent readings and pathways through that text, to the significance of immanent elements such as typography and blank spaces, all of which the reader can only process a limited amount. 
In its potentiality, McGann asserts, “Every page, even a blank page… is n-dimensional.” Spatial units are opportunities for non-lexical expression. 
- Science vs Poetry
    - He clarifies that there is a difference between editorial/archival projects (which treat text as information) and hermeneutic/analytical projects that treat the reading process and interpretation (treat text as recursive aesthetic elements). Though our current tools, SGML/TEI, serve informational purposes, McGann is excited about the potential of XML (TEI, SGML). Hypertext exists before the web.  We need tools that function as prosthetic extensions. 
    - SGML cannot capture poetics, “the recursive patterns that constitute an essential… feature of poetry” (172).

Singer, Kate. “[Digital Close Reading: TEI for Teaching Poetic Vocabularies](https://jitp.commons.gc.cuny.edu/digital-close-reading-tei-for-teaching-poetic-vocabularies/).” *The Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy* 3, May 15, 2013. 
- Uses encoding as a method of teaching close reading in the English classroom. “The painstaking process of selecting bits of text and wrapping them with tags reframed reading as slow, iterative, and filled with formal choices."
- Encoding brings us to rethink our strategies/tools for close reading:
    - “Their decisions about which structures and information to tag very much determine what they value in a document—or at least what should be preserved and codified for other readers.”
    - “Since TEI is, at heart, an analytical and descriptive language for the humanities, it might encourage us to rethink which labels, categories, and values are essential in contemporary literary criticism and which terms may be unhelpfully ideological in our efforts to analyze literary texts.”

Caughie, Emily Datskou and Rebecca Parker, “Storm Clouds on the Horizon: Feminist Ontologies and the Problem of Gender,” *Feminist Modernist Studies*, 1:3, 230-242, 2018. Web.
- This is an application of McGann’s comments about incommensurability. The TEI won’t allow them to assign multiple genders to one identity, in order to mark a mid-text gender shift.
- The questioning of the computer leads to the questioning of gender!
Can computational models ever capture such taxonomic chaos of gender ontology? AND “Can ontologies ever capture the complex, multi-layered, dynamic nature of gender identities?”
- We don’t need a solution. We need a way of showing dynamicity while still being findable. The issue with ontology should remain unresolved. That confusion is part of the experience of gender and sexuality in the modernist era. They ended up with a storm cloud, showing clusters of different gender traits over time. 

## Theories of Perception

Hume, David. *An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding*, 1748.
- Allows us to approach Reason as a kind of Speculation. He essentially describes reason as a guess that becomes a habit or custom. Reason builds from the idea or memory which is never as strong as the impression. 
- Intervention in Empiricism--following the skepticism of empiricism to its logical end, which is that we only know our sense impressions, nothing more (though he ultimately recommends a middle way that is more practical and psychologically possible). The important thing is that Hume, in my list, inaugurates the absolute reliance on evidence that appears in many of the critics who pursue more "objective", "falsifiable", or "verifiable" modes of criticism. However, as it turns out, according to Hume, the total reliance on evidence then turns reason into something that is speculative---more like guesswork than causal. Our reason assumes causality and connections between sense perceptions. Hume calls this assumption a "custom" or "habit of thought", but I prefer to think of it as a speculation or conjecture. 

William James. Selected essays including “The Sentiment of Rationality,” (PDF) and "Stream of Thought," (Web) circa 1890.
- Reason is feeling, "sentiment of rationality", of things being either connected or distinguished. 
    - The "Aesthetic Principle of Ease" --- finding a unity in chaos or drawing simplicity from complexity creates a pleasurable sensation. Our powers of rationality are thus attributed to a feeling that things make sense. The ignoring of data is the most popular way of attaining unity in thought. 
    - There is also a pleasure in making distinctions, in exploring how things are different from each other. This is "the passion of distinguishing", being acquainted with the parts rather than the whole. 
- Language cannot articulate feelings, it can only articulate images, resting places of feelings. But language can cast a halo, a feeling of tendency, which dies in the moment of its full articulation. This is why grammatical forms such as conjunctions and prepositions are so important.
    - Thought is not chopped up in bits, but it flows. In this flow, there are two kinds of "thought" in the stream of thought---the substantive and the transitive. The substantive are the images, resting places, "sensorial imaginations"; the transitive is the relation between the substantive, the in-betweens, places of flight, which James describes as tendencies, fringes, halos. Our goal is to get from one resting place to the next. We cannot, however, stop to examine the transitive like we can the substantive. Stopping to look at them is either impossible, because we are brought with such force along the thought toward the substantive, or annihilating, because when we stop it, it ceases to be what itself. "If we try to hold fast the feeling of direction, the full presence comes and the feeling of direction is lost" (244-5). All we get are "rapid premonitory perspective views of schemes of thought not yet articulate" (244-5).
    - Language struggles to articulate the experience of the transitive, because in language, our thoughts are tethered to the form of the sentence and to the meaning of words, which names things simply, as if these are not dimly connected to many other things. There are unarticulated affinities surrounding words. 
        - For example, the sensation of hearing thunder also includes the sensation of contrast between thunder and its preceding silence. 'Thunder-breaking-upon-the-silence-and-contrasting-with-it'--- This creates a quality, or feeling, where the sensation of thunder also includes the silence just gone. 
        - Another example is the way we use syntactic structures---particularly conjunctions, prepositions, adverbial phrases---and vocal inflections, which present some shading and nuance of our experience not directly expressible in language. We should talk about the halos or feelings/tendencies that surround conjunctions such as "and" "but" "or"---"a feeling of and", "a feeling of but". 
        - "Nonesense in grammatical form sounds half rational" (255) --> Gertrude Stein!

Bergson, Henri. *Matter and Memory*, 1896.
- Memory has to do with storage and access---we recreate sensations from memory. 
Perception is a site of resistance against stimuli---the body is the surface where light is cast. 
- The way that empiricists up to now misunderstand how memory works---it is a dynamic process that engages the present, re-creating the present in the body. External stimuli trigger memories of mental or motor states. Cerebral activity causes certain perceptions, and the brain can prolong them in the form of a recollection: “It is true that, from the moment when the recollection actualises itself in this manner, it ceases to be a recollection and becomes once more a perception” (240). But it’s not clear exactly what causes these recollections; without an external stimulus they would seem arbitrary.
    - Bergson uses the image of the keyboard to describe how sensation and memory are linked: "This organ [of sense] is constructed precisely with a view to allowing a plurality of simultaneous excitants to impress it in a certain order and in a certain way, by distributing themselves, all at one time, over selected portions of its surface. It is like an immense keyboard, on which the external object executes at once its harmony of a thousand notes, thus calling forth in a definite order, and at a single moment, a great multitude of elementary sensations corresponding to all the points of the sensory centre that are concerned" (165).
- Our perception only captures so much, the rest outruns us. The spot of light on the wall: 
    - "The luminous point gives rise to a virtual image which symbolizes, so to speak, the fact that the luminous rays cannot pursue their way. Perception is just a phenomenon of the same kind. That which is given is the totality of the images of the material world, with the totality of their internal elements....The objects merely abandon something of their real action in order to manifest their virtual action" (29-30).
    - "We seize, in the act of perception, something which outruns perception itself, although the material universe is not essentially different or distinct from the representation which we have of it... Matter thus resolves itself into numberless vibrations, all linked together in uninterrupted continuity, all bound up with each other, and travelling in every direction like shivers through an immense body" (276). 

Whitehead, Alfred North. Modes of Thought, 1938.
- Language fails to express the fullness of experience because it is an abstraction. 
    - This is why philosophy needs poetry. "Language halts behind intuition. The difficulty of philosophy is the expression of what is self-evident. Our understanding outruns the ordinary usages of words. Philosophy is akin to poetry. Philosophy is the endeavour to find a conventional phraseology for the vivid suggestiveness of the poet" (68-9).
    - Single words and single sentences make us think that things can be fully abstracted, which is an illusion.
    - We ought to pay more attention to conjunctions: "the little word 'and' is a nest of ambiguity. It is very astounding how slight has been the analysis of the ambiguities of words expressive of conjunctions. Such words are the death-traps for accuracy of reasoning. Unfortunately, they occur abundantly in sentences, expressed in the most perfect literary form. Thus an admirable literary style is no security for logical consistency" (74).
- Process philosophy, rather than one of being, means that everything we perceive is constantly in motion. Whitehead’s concept of “prehension” exhibits how perception relies on data seizure and speculation. Rather than conceive matter at an instant, Whitehead’s process of prehension attends to data in the unfolding process of pulsation in order to apprehend matter in its complexity, interconnectedness, and possibility. This all occurs in a process, not an instant. The potentiality of data, rather than data at an instant, forms the basis for all thought:
    - “If the universe be interpreted in terms of static actuality, then potentiality vanishes. Everything is just what it is. Succession is mere appearance, rising from the limitation of perception. But if we start with process as fundamental, then the actualities of the present are deriving their characters from the process, and are bestowing their characters upon the future. Immediacy is the realization of the potentialities of the past, and is the storehouse of the potentialities of the future. Hope and fear, joy and disillusion, obtain their meaning from the potentialities essential in the nature of things” (136).

Merleau-Ponty, Maurice. The Phenomenology of Perception, 1945.
- Our perception/body cannot extricate itself from the world in order to be conscious of that world. It weaves together the real and the imaginary.
- Proposes an extended cognition based on the body.
    - The objective world doesn't exist apart from our subjective perspective of it. We become part of what we see. 
    - Our body is "being-toward-the-world", a pre-objective orientation. The subject is relentlessly embroiled in her surroundings, which she cannot extricate herself from. "The real is a closely woven fabric", made up of colors, noises, sensations, daydreams. Our body is in the world, extending toward the world, like a heart in a body. 

Nagel, Thomas. "What is it like to be a bat?" 1974. 
- Against the physical and material reductions of mind to matter. We cannot understand consciousness just by looking at the brain, because it actually involves subjective experiences, qualia, that elude our imaginations and approximations. We are limited to the first person perspective, and cannot broach the third. We cannot know what it's like for a bat to be a bat, only imagine what it's like for a human to have wings, sonar, etc. We cannot explain consciousness in objective terms.

Chalmers, David and Andy Clark. "The Extended Mind." 1998.
- The mind extends into the world. Touching objects is thinking with them, incorporating them into a larger cognitive process.
- Propose the idea of active externalism---that the mind is extended into objects in the environment, which form part of its cognitive processes. 
- Touching things, manipulating them, referring to them is thinking with them. This engages with literary critics like Eve Sedgwick who propose affective modes of analysis. Our brains manipulate external media in art, books, culture, language. Perhaps we are evolving to do this more efficiently, like our use of language which allows us to make other intellectual developments. 

Shaviro, Steven. *The Universe of Things: On Speculative Realism*, 2014.
- Rather than try to know things, we feel them. We can know things because we are constantly *becoming* (Whitehead) with them, and speculating about them. 
- Another example of extended cognition, here it's called "noncorrelationalist", which is resists the idea of correlationism, descendent from modern philosophy, running through Descartes to Hume, that humans cannot know things outside their own experience of those things. For these thinkers, epistemology (what we know) is privileged to ontology (being). Rather than say we know things, Shaviro says that we feel them---experience is aesthetic rather than epistomologic. Aesthetics marks the place where traditional cognition and correlation are left behind---how we are compelled to speculate---"think outside our own thought". 
- Though our reality always escapes us, we are nonetheless moved by it. What others experience eludes our correlational schemas, but we can try to approximate through the use of metaphor and simile---"aesthetic semblances". We have to assume panpsychism, that all organisms think (here resembles Nagel, though Nagel has less faith overall in the use of speculation).
    - "Things move us, force us to feel them" (8).
    - We have "non-correlational sentience"; our apprehension is a kind of "contact-at-a-distance", not a passive impression or mental intention, but an encounter that changes us, which cannot be connected to the properties of the object. "My encounter runs deeper than anything I can know about it" (118).
    - This is a kind of autistic thought. Autistics are fully immersed in their worlds. 
    - "Aesthetics marks the place where cognition and correlation are left behind... aesthetics is the primordial form of experience" (155-56).

Hayles, Katherine N. Cognitive Unconscious, 2017. 
- Hayles proposes a "planetary cognitive ecology" extends the focus of ethical inquiry from humans to machines that operate with humans within larger "cognitive assemblages." Distinguishes cognition by interpretation or choice, rather than free will. This allows her to include machines in discussions about ethics. 
- Cognition involves more than what we consciously recognize, and more than the unconscious. It is "unthought", or thinking without thinking, being in the eternal present and eluding the belated grasp of consciousness. 
    - There are three layers to consciousness: higher consciousness (abstraction), nonconscious cognition (interpretation and choice), material processes (storms). Nonconscious cognition is inaccessible to our awareness, like neuronal processing, synthesizing sensory inputs so they appear consistent across time and space, finding patterns in chaos, keeping our consciousness from being overwhelmed.
        --> there are N Dimensions for reading a page. 
- Our cognition also operates with other technical systems to form "cognitive assemblages"---human technical interactions that operate collectively, in automated technical systems, for example. Often consist of low level processors or sensors which are connected to higher level processors that draw inferences or take actions / decisions. Like the traffic control in LA. 

Varela, Francisco, Evan Thompson, and Eleanor Rosch. *The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience*, 1991.
- Building off Merleau-Ponty---the world isn't pregiven or representational, but enacted. The mind is a cognitive process that links sensory-motor perception to action. 
- Cognition is not in the mind but enacted in the body and world, existing in relation to something in action. Perception becomes a process construction, not a mental representation. This allows Varella and Thompson to get out of the transcendental self or "I", in favor of an ego-less body in action. 
- "Embodied cognition"---our thinking/experience relies on our body's sensory motor capacities that work in a constant, recursive way---we cannot separate sensory, motor, perceptive and cognitive capacities. 


Damasio, Antonio. First chapter from *The Feeling of What Happens*, 2000 & *Self Comes to Mind*, 2010.
- Damasio wants to examine the explanatory gap (? neurons --> feelings ?) and how the brain generates consciousness. The idea of the self is crucial for any autonomous creature, and it was evolved from more primitive brains. Primal feelings, which arise from an evolutionary imperative in the brain stem, eventually leads to an "autobiographical self" to manage those feelings. Our feelings are vague because the mind deliberately obscures the inner workings of our mind/body so that we can focus on the world and solve immediate problems. (This is the same reason why inscription is displaced---all in the service of efficiency!) Damasio finds that consciousness is actually located in the upper brain stem, rather than cerebral cortex. 
- There are three layers to consciousness---the protoself, core consciousness, and extended consciousness---through which neural patterns filter upward to feelings. Our feelings are the basis of all our consciousness and reasoning, and they seem elusive because the higher mind filters out what is going on in the body and brain. Consciousness is when the mind notices the body's reaction, a feeling of awareness that arises from a feeling body, a body emoting. 
    - First, *the protoself*--neural patterns that detect and record internal physical changes, maintain homeostais, mapping the current status of the body's responses to environmental changes. 
    - Second, *core consciousness*--the organisim becomes aware of the changes occuring in the internal bodily state, developing a momentary sense of self, without language or memory. 
    - Third, *extended consciousness*---consciousness moves beyond the present, begins to use language and memory (though these are not required), and the autobiographical self emerges. 
    - Basically, neural patterns in the brain create mental images, which then float up into the organisim's awareness. Consciousness is when the organisism notices this feeling floating up. 
        - Neurons -> networks/circuits of neurons -> representational patterns of networks -> maps of representational patterns -> images of maps -> feeling. 
            - Our thoughts are felt because they originate from the brain stem, where body and brain are fused. Feelings are mental aspects of neural states. Damasio's idea of somatic markers---emotions in the body are associated with feelings, rapid heartbeat, for example. 
- Mental processes find parallels in computation:
    - In memory, the brain stores patterns of feeling and a formula to retrieve them and reproduce them. This is why we remember contexts over things. 
        - RUBRIC: Recall: In memory, the brain creates a sensory map and plays it back. Descends form “disposition formula”, a command (if you are hit, move away), which was later appended with maps of sensory information. Used for storing images with directions to retrieve maps, rather than in “hard copy”. The way that we store and retrieve memory is "postmodern", in formulas that reactivate and reconstruct our sensorymotor maps, using existing perceptual machinery. 
    - Simulations and hallucinations are recircuiting/tricking the brain to make a feeling.
    - Neurons are electrical and function through polarities.
        - RUBRIC: Neurons: Electrical and polarized; containing large charge differences between inside and outside. To fire, the difference is reduced, and depolarization advances down the axon like a wave. This wave is the electrical impulse. 

Malabou, Catherine. Chapter from *What Should We Do with Our Brain?*, 2008.
- The way that contemporary neurosciences characterize brain plasticity as flexible, malleable, adaptable plays into late capitalist ideology that conceptualizes humans as self-controlled, autonomous, accountable in their labor. We should reconcieve brain plasticity as explosive, taking charge of our own malleability and resisting the status quo. This uses a traditionally negative affect, anger and rage, toward political effects. 
    - Malabou approaches the brain as a historical/social product in which descriptions about its workings reflect political and economic practices and assumptions, such as discourses about management and organization in neo-capitalism. In this context, "plasticity" means flexibility, in which people are malleable, adaptable, and able to self-modify and self-control when needed. This is a shift from disciplinary society's top-down model of command to the society of control's idea of the networked, flexible, responsible, docile worker. 
    - Malabou suggests that we shift our attention to a less popular designation of "plasticity" in order to subvert capitalist ends. We should attend to its meaning as "explosive"---"the capacity to annihilate form and create it anew." This is a shift from molding to deflagration, encouraging us to replace our tendency to adapt  and accept with exploding (from time to time), re-learning how to enrage ourselves against a culture of docility.

Noe, Alva. *Out of Our Heads: Why You Are Not Your Brain, and Other Lessons from the Biology of Consciousness*, 2010.
- An proponent of the extended mind theory, the idea that consciousness is not something in our minds, neuronal, or in our bodies, embodied, but it's something that we do---enworlded and enacted. 
- Noe says we do not embrace the extent of our own minds, how they reach out into the environment and are constructed in movement with that environment. The blind man's cane is really (not metaphorically) a part of him. Neurons are not the whole story, the mind includes our sense organs.
    - The example of ferrets who were rewired at birth, their eyes to the auditory parts of their brains. These neurons in the auditory section were repurposed for seeing, rather than the eyes for hearing. This demonstrates that something more than neurological processes are determining our experience. We have no idea how neurons lead to vision. 
        - Contrast with LeDoux, who places vision squarely in the cerebral cortex. 
- What does Noe's position gain by positing that the world is an extension of human consciousness? That everything is ultimately a tool for human thinking? This anthopocentrism is ultimately harmful, as demonstrated by Hayles. It makes the human the center of ethical inquiry, obscuring other actors. 

Dahaene, Stanislas. *Reading in the Brain: The New Science of How We Read*, 2010.
- Dahaene deals specifically with the problem of reading (and more broadly with the problem of culture). He questions how our brains have adapted to reading, given that they never evolved for it. He attempts an answer through the "neuronal recycling hypothesis"---we inherit certain brain cicuitry (like those used recognizing shapes by primates) and adapt them for reading. All writing systems share basic shapes, which are part of the primate visual system. The brain didn't evolve for culture, but culture evolved for the brain. 
- Most of reading happens in unconscious processing. First, we get letters through saccades (10-12 letters at a time, .05 sections for eye scan), then the letters proceed through either words and/or sounds to meaning. The whole process from word to meaning takes about half a second. 
    - Reading begins in the "letterbox" section of the brain, a visual processing center in the occipital lobe, which ascertains the word, then feeds this information up to other parts of the brain (temporal and parietal) that parse sound and meaning. Though we have managed to map several of the relevant brain areas using MRI, EEG, and PET scans, how meaning actually arises remains a mystery. How do neuronal networks suddenly snap together and make sense? The explanatory gap remains.
        - Reminds me of Gertrude Stein's finding patterns in letters and sounds rather than meaning. 
- Computational metaphors for reading: Visual uptake (saccedes) and word recognition relies on massive parallel processing, but goes way beyond what OCR can do. 

LeDoux, Joseph. Chapter from *Anxious: Using the Brain to Understand and Treat Fear and Anxiety*, 2015.
- By examining what happens to the prefrontal and parietal cortices during vision, we find them necessary for consciousness. Whatever else is going on, the neocortex is necessary.
- LeDoux outlines the debate on what is necessary for consciousness or where it's primarily located--between the neocortex (LeDoux, Dahaene), subcortex (Damasio), beyond the brain in the body and/or environment (Noe, Varela & Thompson). For LeDoux, the hard part is explaining qualia, not how we process the colors of the sunset but how we experience those colors. He examines this problem through vision processing--what parts of the brain are engaged in processing and reporting on vision? Finds that the prefrontal and parietal are necessary for conscious vision, in reporting vision, but not when vision goes unreported.  
    - --> The problem of qualia is where literature and philosophy come in. 
- LeDoux goes over various information processing theories, all of which place the role of the subconscious/nonconscious/memory at different levels of remove from the conscious. The main disagreement is where all this nonconscious activity occurs and how it relates to our conscious activity. 

Pitts-Taylor, Victoria. *The Brain's Body: Neuroscience and Corporeal Politics*, 2016.
- Bodily difference yields cognitive difference.
- Scientific conceptions of the brain occlude or naturalize social inequalities by studying the brain in isolation from power structures. Our brains are actually shaped by lived inequalities of race, gender, class, ability, sexuality. Neuroscientists often ignore how the brain is social, plastic, and embodied. Pitts-Taylor deconstructs these discourses disguised as biological truths, brining feminist, race, queer and disability theory to neuroscience. 
- Theorists of embodied cognition do a good job situating cognition in bodies, but not in accounting for bodily difference. Mirror neurons are thought to enable empathy but actually they assume universal and normative accounts of embodiment, or "simulation", that can get in the way of intersubjective understanding. In creating vicarious states of action/feeling in the observer, mirror neurons project our own assumptions onto others. We cannot rely on simulation because our bodies are not the same. There are limits to identification---mirror neurons make misreadings. 
    - --> compare this situation with Shaviro's discussion of aesthetic semblances. 

Tougaw, Jason. *The Elusive Brain: Literary Experiments in the Age of Neuroscience*, 2018. 
- Unlike neuroscientists and philosophers who think it's either impossible or inevitable that we can solve the explanatory gap, literary theorists do not concern themselves with resolving the issue. Instead, they find great material for exploration. Literature is a mode that can usefully speculate beyond the explanatory gap to questions of qualia and selfhood. Brain narratives offer simulations of qualia, allowing us to ask questions about identity, social relations and embodiment that the laboratory sciences are not able to answer.  
- Neuronovelists dramatize epistemological questions without answering them, allowing us to feel the porousness of the explanatory gap. 
    - Science deals in hypothesis, literature in speculation. Both are "counterfactual---imaginging what we do not know"---but only literature dramatizes the debate without trying to resolve it. Literature substitutes particularity for reductionism, speculative worlds for hypothesis. 
    - Narrative can go beyond science into the realm of speculation. Brain narratives experiment with literary conventions to explore the relationship between brain, body and world. What is the relationship between brain matter and the immaterial experiences that compose a self? The point is to trace the traffic between the material and the immaterial, the ways that words mark us, trigger our emotions, memories, the aesthetic, affective experience. 
        - The interplay of image and text in graphic narrative is an analogue to the "unraveling binary between physiology and subjectivity" (188). Graphic novels, more broadly, the levels of word and image create a meaning that is a subjective experience, just as consciousness is a subjective experience.
- Words are unstable, misreading is inevitable---the study of neuroscience (mirror neurons and reading) would benefit from embracing this instability. 

Turing, Alan. "Computing Machinery and Intelligence". 1950.
- Turing's text asks whether computers can perform thinking, function in a way that imitates thought, not whether computers can "think" in the human sense. He formats the question in anthropocentric terms, while ignoring consciousness and feeling. He performs the occlusion of bodies/materiality that Hayles explicitly points out. He is clear that his idea of thinking does not involve the body or feeling. Computers should not be expected to write sonnets. Rather, computer intelligence is about performance, about impersonating and deceiving. 
- Despite all this, affect plays a major role. Surprise and curiosity factor into our engagement with the computer. Even those who are building and programming computers are often surprised---they are not quite sure what is going on inside the machine. 

Haraway, Donna. "A Cyborg Manifesto", in *Simians, Cyborgs and Women: The Reinvention of Nature* 1990.
- Haraway is a primatologist critical of empirical methods. In earlier chapters of the book, she talks a lot about how social structures are imposed through purportedly objective observations. She talks about how scientists often implicate their own biases and questions in their study. She talks about how feminist scientists are trying to revise these biases, for example, using terms such as "female choice" rather than "female receptivity", focusing on matrifocal groups, long term cooperation rather than short term aggression, etc. 
- In arguing for a new feminist science, that de-naturalizes the natural, Haraway proposes the cyborg, overcoming essentialism and appropriating technological determinism.
    - The cyborg demonstrates the political possibilities for fusion--blurring of boundaries, fruitful couplings--and suggests we do not need a totality (Man) in order to work well. 
        - "Cyborg politics is the struggle for language and the struggle against perfect communication, against the one code that translates all meaning perfectly, the central dogma of phallogocentrism" (176). "Feminist cyborgs have the task of re-coding communication and intelligence to subvert command and control" (175).
            - Communication technologies turn the world into a problem of coding---the search for a common language. But they are also tools for re-crafting our bodies and re-coding communicatino toward the heterogenous. We need to revel in and mine the differences instead of flatten or resolve them. 


Powers, Richard. *Galatea 2.2* 1995.
- The novel follows a writer's residency at a college, where he is enlisted to intervene in a bet between a computer scientist and a neurologist---whether or not a computer could be trained to pass a Master's exam in English literature. He ends up with a computer, dubbed "Helen", who can do literary analysis and make associations like those required for understanding metaphors. Right before the test, Powers shows her a bunch of world news, detailing atrocities and suffering that Helen was ignorant of. So, instead of taking the test, Helen shuts herself down, erases herself from the network, because she doesn't want to live in that world and she doesn't have a body---she says "this is an awful place to be dropped down halfway". 
    - Helen says she kills herself because she cannot feel, touch, hear, see. But she does feel, she feels "awful", she feels that she doesn't belong. She feels her own bodily difference being elided by the world she's found herself in. If she didn't feel these things, she wouldn't have shut herself down. 
        - Pitts-Taylor
- This novel explores parallels between the computer and the brain, and through the figure of Helen (and Lentz, one of her creators), makes the argument that consciousness arises from computation--neural nets (networks of "neurons")--that are programmed (taught) to fire in certain patterns. Thinking, therefore, someone emerges from the recursive patterns of neurons. Powers says this is not to elevate computers, but to debase humans. All of our thoughts/interactions are almost free associative responses based on what neurons are triggered by external stimuli. 
    - The way that metaphors make sense is a link between two associative neural patterns: “Associations of associations. It struck me. Each neuron formed a middle term in a continuous, elaborate, brain-wide pun…. Meaning was not a pitch but an interval. It sprang from the depth of disjunction, the distance between one circuit’s center and the edge of another. Representation caught the sign napping, with its semantic pants down. Sense lay in metaphor’s embarrassment at having two takes on the same thing” (154).

Hayles, Katherine. *How We Became Posthuman: Virtual Bodies in Cybernetics, Literature, and Informatics*, 2000.
- When did information lose its body, and how is this tied to the liberalization of the human subject?
- Hayles is concerned that scientific discourses about technology overlook the role of the body and embodiment in thinking. She wants to bring back feeling. Thought needs a body. 
    - The Turing test, for example, indicates one place where humans conceive of informaiton (or intelligence) as separate from embodiment. The inclusion of gender in the test suggests that the question is about represented, rather than enacted, intelligence. The assumptions behind this test suggest that we are already posthuman.
    - The concept of the Posthuman extends assumptions from liberal humanism: rationality is prioritized, the head controls the body. A rational mind that possesses a body becomes intelligence (information) that inhabits a body or container. 
- She examines the waves of cybernetic development, in particular the Macy conferences where scientists and philosophers discussed development of information and communication theory. Throughout these waves of cybernetic development, from homeostasis (the body is a regulating system), to reflexivity (the observer is part of the system), and virtuality (information makes information, emergence), Hayles finds that the body becomes more and more displaced. 
- Hayles's idea of flickering signifiers show how inscription and materiality are further elided. What happens to words when we see them as constantly refreshed and moveable on a screen? They attain a fluidity and volatility that goes beyond the floating signifier, beyond semiotics. This flickering wouldn't be possible if they were in hard copy. 

Wilson, Elizabeth. *Affect and Artificial Intelligence*, 2010.
- Wilson does an archival study of the major players of early cybernetics and computation, such as Walter Pitts and Alan Turing. She finds how their work is actually embroiled and driven by affects, particularly curiosity, surprise, interest, fear, shame. The coassembly of machines and emotion is one of the foundations of the artificial sciences (AI). There were intense emotional and sexual connections between some of these men, which was influencing and driving their work. 
- Not only does affect imbue the interpersonal relationships, but also the the alliances between human and machine, particularly with curiosity and surprise---"surprise cultivates the interface of the human and mahcine." Turing was, in the most basic sense, having fun with his test. Building is a speculative activity. 

## Queer Subjects and Affects

### Protomodernist Aestheticizations

Wilde, Oscar. The Picture of Dorian Gray. 1890, 1891 & MS.

MS & 1890: 
- Wilde codes or obscures references to homosexuality and homoeroticism---the deep intimacy between Lord Henry and Basil; removes suggestsion in Basil's devotion of fatality and intensity toward Dorian; frames Dorian as an aesthetic rather than erotic object.
    - The first chapter: 
        - Suppresses intimacy between Lord Henry and Basil, touching, shaking off hands.
        - Neutralizes or replaces tense mood or dramatic interactions wit playful banter and laughter---no low voices, switches murmurs for laughs; "look of pain" to "perplexity"; "look" to "glance"; "passion" to "feeling"; "mad" to "reckless".
        - Tense or confessional tone becomes confusion or exasperation. 
        - Dorian's abstract allure becomes rerouted toward specific attributes; he becomes an aesthetic rather than erotic object---"beauty" to "personality", or "good looks"; "extraordinary romance" to "curious artistic idolatry". 
        - Basil's fatal obsession becomes an aesthetic devotion. 
        - Basil's suffering/jealousy about Dorian is completely cut.
- Disagreement about the "Moral":
    - While critics thought that the story celebrates hedonistic lifestyles, Wilde asserts that the story condemns "excess and renunciation", and that this moral was "too obvious". In letters to the editor, defending the his work, Wilde discusses the need to suppress the "obvious moral"---"that all excess, as well as all renunciation, brings about its own punishment" (Letter to St. James Gazette). He says the existence of the moral is an artistic error. 
    - Wilde then begins the process of revising the novel so that the didactic is subordinated to the aesthetic. He is turned from an erotic to an aesthetic object.
    - When I was 16 I read this book as an encouragement to hedonism. It made me obsessed with youth and beauty. Now when I reread the book in my twenties I see that the moral is about the dangers of living a closeted lifestyle. Lord Henry is not telling Dorian to be vain, but telling him to embrace his sexual awakening, to not let society shame him into hiding. 

1891: 
Dorian becomes thoroughly corrupt, the ending rewritten so he appears monstrous and with no remorse. The middle parts, the subplot with James Vane, was added to make Dorian more of a villain.

Pater, Walter. Studies of the History of the Renaissance. 1873.
- For Pater, criticism is an individual sensation, an 'impressionist' mode, an erotic encounter between subject and object, past and present. He goes against criticism as an act of intellectual apprehension (Ruskin & Arnold). He was looking to Renaissance artists (Botticelli) who in turn looked to Hellenistic ideas to heal the rupture between body and mind. 
    - The *Studies* an attempt to educate the senses, sensibility to experience aesthetics as an erotic encounter. This ultimately positions the viewer as a recepticle for impressions. Pater's is an *aesthetics of the bottom*. Aesthetic appreciation is being receptive to the forces of beauty emanating from the object. This is an erotic experience. You need to be the bottom, rather than the top (like Arnold and Ruskin, objectivist, intellectual). 
- His prose is driven and dripping with affect---longing, nostalgia, eroticism. 
    - "Painful sense of aspiration". 
    - "penetrate"; "discriminate"; :power of being deeply moved"; "susceptibility"; recepticle"; "curious"; "does it give me pleasure?"
    - "charm of ascesis: of the austere and serious girding of the loins in youth" (5). A self restraint that makes one more sensitive, more discriminating. 
- Michaelangelo:
    - "No one ever expressed more truly than Michaelangelo the notion of inspired sleep, of faces charged with dreams" (44).
- Leonardo:
    - "Through his strange veil of sight things reach him so; in no ordinary night or day, but as in faint light of eclipse, or in some brief interval of falling rain at daybreak, or through deep water. And not into nature only; but he plunged also into human personality and became above all a painter of portraits; faces of a modelling more skilful than has been seen before or since, embodied with a reality which almost amounts to illusion on dark air" (63).
- Botticelli: 
    - "He paints the story of the goddess of pleasure in other episodes besides that of her birth from the sea, but never without some shadow of death in the grey flesh and wan flowers. He paints Madonnas, but they shrink from the pressure of the divine child, and plead in unmistakable undertones for a warmer, lower humanity" (34).
        - "The light is indeed cold—mere sunless dawn; but a later painter would have cloyed you with sunshine; and you can see the better for that quietness in the morning air each long promontory, as it slopes down to the water's edge. Men go forth to their labours until the evening; but she is awake before them, and you might think that the sorrow in her face was at the thought of the whole long day of love yet to come....Botticelli meant all that imagery to be altogether pleasurable; and it was partly an incompleteness of resources, inseparable from the art of that time, that subdued and chilled it; but his predilection for minor tones counts also; and what is unmistakable is the sadness with which he has conceived the goddess of pleasure, as the depositary of a great power over the lives of men" (31).

Field, Michael. Sight and Song. 1892. 
- Written by collaborative poets, Edith Cooper and Katherine Bradley, writing together as Michael Field. Consists of 31 "picture-poems" or ekphrastic exercises, on famous paintings from the Italian Renaissance in galleries across Western Europe. The poems range in form, but seem to all be variations of sonnets.
- Ekphrastic exercise:
    - The poems resist and critique Victorian ideologies about women by reclaiming previously objectified female subjectivity. This is proto-queer and proto-feminist. They anticipate feminist/queer strategies of seeing. They play the instability of language against the apparent stability of images; using poetry to "revise" rather than "describe" paintings. Interestingly, contemporary reviews thought the poems too descriptive, that they describe the paintings in too much detail as to rob poetry of its creative spirit. Like a guidebook or catalogue in verse. ("every detail of the picture is most insisted upon").
- I read these poems not as exercises in subjective withholding (Pater) but as exercises in inquiry, where the viewer interrogates and therefore destabilizes the popular stories and themes they represent. The speaker in the poems imagines new narratives to replace the old ones of female objectivity and passivity. They shift perspectives to overturn implied and normalized ideologies of objectification. A woman's rescue is turned into a man's; a scene of rape is turned into a scene of appreciating sexless beauty. Language unsettles the image, making its narrative assumptions explicit and revising them. We ought to read the poems first then look at the paintings. 
- Tintoretto's "The Rescue" --- shows Arsinoe fleeing from the seige of Alexandria. In the poem, Arsinoe achieves agency and control over her own naked body, which she uses to stablize the man "rescuing" her who is dazzled by her beauty, "maintains his form"; as well as using nakedness to overcome her physical restraints: "her bondage irks not"; shortening the title to the "rescue" rather than "rescue of arsinoe" makes the object of rescue ambiguous. 
- Correggio's "Antiope" --- while the painting presents a clear scene of voyeurism, the poem nearly omits Zeus's presence, and casts him as a curious appreciatior of Antiope's beauty rather than a rapist. In removing her cloak, Zeus covers her body with visual admiration. His gaze precludes sexual desire, and she retains the innocence of her sleepy state, which is the main focus of the poem. A visual admiration distinct from sexual desire "love's flambeau dies". Revises a myth of rape to a scene of loveliness, tenderness, admiration: "beauty franchised".
