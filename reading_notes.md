## Digital Methods and Textualitites

### Methods 

Moretti, Franco. *Graphs, Maps, Trees: Abstract Models for Literary History*. 2007. Print.
- Moretti supports a positivist agenda for literary criticism. He ascribes an objective status to visualizations, as if they aren’t based on subjective research (monographs!) and his own decision making. He also neglects to fully embrace his own readings as subjective, and calls them “explanations” rather than “interpretations”. 
- Basically, Moretti minimizes his role as a critic, in service of a larger, collective project on doing literary history. But he doesn’t have to minimize the critic’s reading to feel like he’s part of a collective. 

Drucker, Johanna. "Introduction," *SpecLab: Digital Aesthetics and Projects in Speculative Computing*. 2009. PDF.
- Drucker uses the computer for creative ends. Computation geared toward speculation rather than testing or confirmation. 
- Doesn’t this line of argument perpetuate the idea that the computer is more objective than the human? That the computer ultimately remains a rational tool? Isn’t it just pointing the direction of interpretation at a new target, which is speculation, while still using the same gun? Is this right?
- How would speculation and potentiality play into a feminist project/reading?

Ramsay, Stephen. *Reading Machines: Toward an Algorithmic Criticism*. 2011. Print.
- Ramsay positions himself as a moderate, saying that computers are merely tools, part of a more expansive subjective process, of hermeneutics. His ideas herer agree nicely with Drucker’s in Speclab. 
- What’s particularly useful about Ramsay is his opposing of humanistic endeavor against scientific inquiry. This specifies how observation is a phenomenal, subjective experience, and is antithetical to the motives and processes of scientific inquiry, the scientific method. Ramsay allows us to understand how empirics(?) can be subsumed within a humanistic frame, which does not attempt to ascertain “truth” but only “potentiality”. 
- Like Drucker, isn't Ramsay speaks as if the computer is this uber-objective tool? Like code/software has no biases or idiosyncrasies? What about examining the way that these processes encode subjectivity? 

Drucker, Johanna. "Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display." *DHQ: Digital Humanities Quarterly*. 2011. Web.
- Drucker argues that data visualization tools and techniques naturalize and flatten things that are actually complex and ambiguous. She proposes that we switch “data” (given) for “capta” (taken), to emphasize how all information has been constructed, pre-cooked (never raw). She proposes that we skew and blur and disrupt the neatness of our graphs and charts. 
- But isn’t this just turning criticism into poetry? Don’t we need something stronger, clearer,more delineated?
- What is the role is clarity and “realist” or “natural” constructions of knowledge?

Felski, Rita. *The Limits of Critique.* 2015. PDF.
- Felski usefully talks about reading as an affective orientation. It’s not about the way that we read, but about the way that we position ourselves and our desires around texts. She warns that suspicious attitudes toward texts foreclose the possibility for new readings, new thoughts. 

Piper, Andrew. *Enumerations: Data and Literary Study*, 2018. Print.
- This shows how distant and close reading can be used together --- Distant reading provides context, or framework, for close reading; in which number becomes a lens, a frame of the quantitative, to approach closer readings and even inform further model building. 
- Though computation facilitates literary analysis, a number of flawed premises about distance, bigness, or objectivity (which lack a science of generalization), have clouded the ways we approach computation (9).
    - “Entanglement is a far more appropriate way of thinking about literary modeling than the disembodied eye in the sky of the lone, distant reader” (19).
        - By incorporating models/graphs/visualizations, “We are no longer using our own judgments as benchmarks... but explicitly constructing the context through which something is seen as significant (and the means through which significance is assessed).... It interweaves subjectivity with objects” (17). 
- With Machine Learning, engages a speculative method: “We see how “feeling” is gradually redefined over time by the novel away from an emotional state to one of perceptual encounter. This sense of the contemporary novel’s investment in sensorial embodiment awaits fuller treatment” (117). 

### Networks

Galloway, Alexander. *Protocol*, 2004. PDF.
- Codes that append all data…controlling power lies in the technical protocols that make network connections possible. “The acceptance of universal standardization in order to facilitate the freer and more democratic medium” (147).
- The flexibility promoted by a control society is actually used to exercise control, requiring autonomous submission. Resistance to this kind of control consists of finding loopholes or “exploits” in systems (what hackers do).
- DNS and TCP/IP engage a vertical (hierarchical) and horizontal (democratic) models of control, with the effect of submitting the “freedom” of movement in the network to the authorization of a controlling head. This paradox between freedom and control, between hierarchy and horizontalism, can perhaps help us to transcend our thinking of computers as disambiguation machines. 
- A protocol is a wrapper---it does not engage in meaning/content, but in possibility, physics or logic. Thinking of protocols as tags that are appended, added on, not changing the data but wrapping it, with possibility. There is a speculative component here. This is about the EXPLOIT.
- “Protocol is a circuit, not a sentence” (52).
- Code is the only language that is executable. It acts out its inscriptions, that it applies to something… Code does what it says, it goes from declaration to movement. Code has a semantic meaning, but it also has an enactment of meaning. It moves. 
    - “Code thus purports to be multidimensional. Code draws a line between what is material and what is active, in essence saying that writing (hardware) cannot do anything, but must be transformed into code (software) to be effective… The algorithm is prepared in advance, then later executed by the artist” (165). 

Chun, Wendy, *Control and Freedom: Power and Paranoia in the Age of Fiber Optics,* 2006. Print.
- How hardware (as opposed to software) engages with the freedom/control paradox of internet networks. 
- To Chun, the issue isn’t the control technologies that drive the internet, but in the way that the workings of the technology is obscured, the ways that protocol is hidden and amplified. We aren’t aware of the packets that pass through our computer, but they are there. “If you believe that your communications are private, it is because software corporations, as they relentlessly code and circulate you, tell you that you are behind, and not in front of, the window” (22)
- All computers engage in this give and take. That’s what make networks possible in the first place. Napster just made this fundamental truth evident.
- The internet’s potential is not in individual empowerment, but in universal exposure, in the way that it exposes us to new visibilities that we cannot control. 
- What are the possibilities opened up by our vulnerabilities?

Bennett, Jane. *Vibrant Matter: A Political Ecology of Things*, 2010. PDF.
- Vitality means that things have their own forces, trajectories, tendencies. 
Thinking of matter as an object or dead makes us destructive; we assert our power/subjectivity over them rather than acknowledge a mutual connection. 
Objectifying something is harmful for us and for them. 
- Rather than be suspicious (hermeneutics of suspicion), which projects an agential/subjective presence, we ought to dwell in a hermeneutics of wonder, of knowing things through intellectual and aesthetic exercises, which motivate fascination (action?) rather than critique. 
- Everything is really an assemblage. Your brain is not “you”, but a collection of processes that are engaging with a bunch of other processes to form “you”. This is the connection to the swarm. A bunch of things are vitalized, and therefore acting in tandem like a swarm. 

Moten, Fred and Stefano Harney. *The Undercommons: Fugitive Planning & Black Study*, 2013. Epub.
- The university is dedicated to re-producing and perpetuating the oppressive and hierarchical orders of society. This cannot be overcome, so one ought to sneak into the university and steal what one can. You can be in but not of the university. 
- How can one be inside of the system and yet resist the system? We can do it by forging connections that are outside of the established “connections”. In other words, by stealing, by feeling each other, by collecting debt, never paying it off, by collective study.  
    - "The undercommons is a fugitive network where a commitment to abolition and collectivity prevails over a university culture bent on creating socially isolated individuals whose academic skepticism and claims of objectivity leave the world as it is intact.” 
- We are broken, but cannot be repaired. All we can do is study, collect debt, and join in the shipped. Study is a mode of thinking with others, an assemblage. Debt is a state of being that we acknowledge but do not attempt to have repaired. We are always building debt, never paying it off. The shipped is where we all are, thrown in together, touching each other, feeling through each other, each other’s feels. 

Tufekci, Zeynep. *Twitter and Tear Gas: the Power and Fragility of Networked Protest*, 2017. PDF.
- Analyzing modern protest and how they use networks to mobilize. She describes how the internet helped the Zapatista uprisings in Mexico, the necessity of remote Twitter users to organize medical supplies during Arab Spring, the refusal to use bullhorns in the Occupy Movement that started in New York.
- There is inherent capacity (practical capacity) and signal capacity (potential capacity), such as promises and threats. Occupy vs SOPA/PIPA. 
- While adhocracy, facilitated by horizontalism, allows for movements to improvise to meet immediate needs, tactical freeze is a potential disruption, an inability to advocate for policies or demands, moves requiring consensus and organization that is antithetical to the horizontal and improvisational structure of adhocracy.  
In such an environment, information and misinformation glut is a real problem, as the important information gets diluted or obscured. Today, gatekeeping is done by governments, algorithms, platforms.

Gaboury, Jacob. ["Becoming NULL: Queer Relations in the Excluded Middle."](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0740770X.2018.1473986) *Women & Performance: a Journal of Feminist Theory*. 28:2, 2018. pp. 143-158. Web.
- Facebook doesn’t care how you identify, but only that your identification is addressable by them. “The move by Facebook allowing for the selection of multiple genders “remain[s] deeply tied to a kind of binary logic, or at the very least a digital one. Put simply, while Facebook gave users more gender options with which to identify, they were still engaging in an act of identification... Here the user has simply been conscripted into enacting the labor of identification once reserved for sophisticated algorithms” (1).
- New systems enact compulsory identification, they do not care how you identify, they only care that you have an identification that is addressable by them. So, What are queer modes of being within technological systems, modes that refuse the gesture of capture and extraction?
- The NULL marker in SQL offers a way of becoming that enacts a queer logic that is explicitly situated within the logic of information systems but refuses this gesture of capture and extraction. A “refusal to cohere, to become legible.” “The use of NULL thus marks an indeterminate mode of being that is at once within and outside, part of and illegible to a discrete system of relations, a “middle” that explicitly marks an indeterminate, incalculable, unknown state of being” (11).

### Language

Barthes, Roland. *S/Z*, 1970. Print.
- Barthes creates a sort of encoding scheme (interpreting according to a series of codes, which create a constellation of meanings across a single text) for Sarrasine. This encoding scheme dramatically opens up meaning, exposes the writerly potential of the text.

Landow, George. *Hypertext 3.0: Critical Theory and New Media in an Era of Globalization*, 2006. Print.
- The hypertext format engages the postmodern (structuralist/post-structuralist and deconstructive) theories about the multiplicity and instability of meaning in texts, as well as new radical conceptions of authorship
- The hypertext is postmodern; hypertext destabilizes the apparently stable, it creates new centers, new tangents, new connections in between textual elements. 

Tenen, Dennis. *Plain Text: the Poetics of Computation*, 2017. Epub.
- Points out that each digital text carries with it a layer of hidden information that determines the display and dissemination of the document. Argues that we need to examine this layer to see how they also determine the way we engage with and interpret the document. There are underlying structures of power in copyright, surveillance, sharing, and modifying text, which is visible only in plain text. 
    - Such media turns us into consumers rather than producers of media. Text that is highly restricted in its encoding threatens our critical ability. 
        - Tenen proposes a microanalysis, computational poetics, or an archaeology of platforms and infrastructures (behind surface content). He points out what elides our notice about these media---that signs are fractured from their inscription (we do not experience how the sign is processed by the computer); and that mediation between human and machine becomes less and less accessible (eventually, we will be able to navigate interfaces with our minds). We don’t engage directly with the textual conduit, so we need to perform a media archaeology in order to have access to these processes and be in charge of them. 
- Shows one cynical consequence of Landow’s argument. Instead of opening up the meaning of the text, of its dynamicity inviting more interpretations, Tenen points out that dynamicity can actually impose restrictions on interpretation. The text on the screen actually hides the ways in which it is already determined. 
- Another interesting complication with the question of affect. Here, Tenen points out how pleasure in reading can actually be a bad thing, can evacuate the critical processes of interpretation. 
    → on the one hand, we have the pleasure of intuitive interfaces and on the other, a short circuiting of critical ability. How does the collapsing/obscuring of mediation between us and our texts affect the way we read them? 

Fisher, Caitlin. *These Waves of Girls*, 2001. Web.
- The profusion of hyperlinks frustrates the reader by offering too many narrative paths. The reader’s frustration in navigating through the hypertext relates to the work’s theme of sexual discovery. In following the narrator as she develops her sexuality, the reader experiences her own cycles of desire and frustration. 
- The reader’s narrative path parallels the theme of sexual discovery.
Additionally, the reader’s narrative desire for closure is related to her sexual desire for release. Narrative/sexual desire conflation. 
    - The desire to write is the desire to fool you, seduce you.”
- The links are associative, they elaborate the linked terms by leading to a single lexia or to another narrative. They can illuminate, echo, or answer another link or lexia. Sometimes we end up in the middle of another narrative. Sometimes we circle back to the same lexia. 
    - FOR example, within the “I have always engaged with impossible comparisons” we click through the arrows to a lexia, “at seven,” which has a link, they'd put their hands on my thigh at the movies, which in fact leads to “Grade two,” another story about the time that an a man fondled the Tracey’s leg at the movies. We have a series of options on this story, and I click the link “the theatre was so dark,” which leads me to a recollection of a night picking fireflies. I click through the arrows, reading through Tracey’s fond and precious memory. The final lexia in this series has a link, “Do they dream about little girls the way I dream about them?” It seems to be referring to the older man (not the fireflies).
- We are always losing context. We read fragments of what was previously written. There is no guidance, the reader decides how to move at every point. It’s all about agency.

Rockwell, Geoffrey and Stefan Sinclair. *Voyant-Tools*. 2018. Web.
- Voyant Tools is a web application, developed out of earlier iterations by Stéfan Sinclair (McGill University) and Geoffrey Rockwell (University of Alberta). It functions as a one-stop-shop for text analysis, offering an easy to use interface that processes text in seconds, organizing it into a series of interactive  lists, charts, graphs, and networks. 
- facilitates:
    - *Praxis as an Hermeneutic* -- The tool’s primary interface on the homepage obscures its documentation to prioritize experimentation over discourse. The blank text box, accompanied by the mysterious “Reveal” button, prompts exploration, where users are invited to jump in without fully knowing how the tool functions, foregrounding the role that ignorance plays in discovering unforeseen elements about the text. 
    - *Speculation* -- Using text-analysis in this way inspires new readings by bringing to light neglected, miniscule, or concealed aspects about texts. The defamiliarization of what we think we know leads us to speculate about other possibilities, and experience more active and playful approaches to inquiry.

### Media

Kittler, Friedrich. *Gramophone, Film, Typewriter*, 1999. Print and PDF.
Asks what if media determined our thought? 
- Whereas, before the 20th century, media passed through symbolism (written signifier), now it is stored as physical traces in sound waves and light. Soon though, all media will lose its specificity, will become streams of numbers, reduced to surface effects (the interface). 
For electronic writing specifically, this evacuates the necessity for “hallucination”: 
- “As long as the book was responsible for all serial data flows, words quivered with sensuality and memory. It was the passion of all reading to hallucinate meaning between lines and letters… once memories and dreams, the dead and ghosts, became technically reproducible, readers and writers no longer needed the powers of hallucination” (10).
Tells us to find pleasure in the circuits:    
- “What remains is what media can store and communicate. What counts are not the messages or the content with which they equip so-called souls for the duration of a technological era, but rather (and in strict accordance with McLuhan) their circuits, the very schematism of perceptibility. Whosoever is able to hear or see the circuits in the synthesized sound of CDs or in the laser storms of a disco finds happiness” (xl-xli).
- We had no way to record orality---which is prior to writing---until after the “monopoly of writing” had ended. Current and prior sense perceptions elided by present technology may in the future come to be recorded and felt. So this opens up possibilities for fiber optics. 
“What will soon end in the monopoly of bits and fiber optics began with the monopoly of writing” (4). What will come of the monopoly of bits and fiber?

Hayles, N. Katherine. *Writing Machines*, 2002. PDF.
- Remediation --- the idea that media is re-conceived or re-written for electronic formats. The “recycling” of different media formats through electronic media (Bolter and Grusin). 
- Technotexts are literary works that self-reflexively engage with their own inscription practices. They explore how many levels of text entwine with bodies, a distributed cognitive environment in which reading takes place. 
- How mediation affects subjectivity, how the interaction between physical and verbal forms construct meaning and therefore, the user/reader. 
- In *House of Leaves*, the remediated narrator evacuates consciousness as the source of production and replaces it with mediated subjectivities. “Consciousness is no longer the relevant frame but rather consciousness fused with technologies of inscription” (116-117).

Kirschenbaum, Matthew. *Mechanisms: New Media and the Forensic Imagination*, 2012. Print.
- Argues for the heterogeneity of digital data---against the idea that they are transient, uniform, copyable, permanent. This combats “screen essentialism”---the idea that what happens on the screen is independent from hardware. It also resists the notion that digital media are totally different from analogue. In fact, a hard drive and a turntable appear and function with striking similarities. 
- Two models --- forensic and formal materiality --- to assess different levels --- physical, logical, and conceptual --- in media. 
    - Forensic Materiality --- the physical world, including the immaterial or virtual (things too small to see). Formal Materiality --- display and appearance, where there is an illusion of immaterial behavior. 
    - “Whereas forensic materiality rests upon the potential for individualization inherent in matter, a digital environment is an abstract projection supported and sustained by its capacity to propagate the illusion (or call it a working model) of immaterial behavior: identification without ambiguity, transmission without loss, repetition without originality” (11).
- The BIT is a symbol of magnetic encoding. It is machine language made human readable; as if humans were to represent sound to an alien who could not hear by writing down phonemes. 
    - The bit is inaccessible to us except in the symbol. This is really the ground zero of … mediation?
- How does RAM, which emerged due to an addressing problem, operate like human memory?
- Operating Systems exist to obscure the act of inscription, first behind a command line, and now behind GUIs. Everything appears evanescent. 

Hansen, Mark. *Feed-Forward: On The Future of 21st Century Media*, 2014. Epub.
- Media in the 21st century largely work outside of our perceptual consciousness but nonetheless inflect our sensations. Technology expands and marginalizes human perceptions. This creates a situation of feed-forward, where consciousness can only pre-engineer its own emergent or just-to-come experiences. Perception is never in the now. 
- “Atmospheric media”; “Worldly capacity for self-sensing”; “environmental sensibility”
- “At one and the same time, 21stC media broker human access to a domain of sensibility that has remained largely invisible (though certainly not inoperative) until now, and, it adds to this domain of sensibility since very individual act of access is itself a new datum of sensation that will expand the world incrementally but in a way that intensifies worldly sensibility” (6, emphasis original)
- Because our perceptual reach is expanded through media, consciousness is always anticipating. 

Woolf, Virginia. "Comparing Marks: A Versioning Edition of Virginia Woolf's 'The Mark on the Wall.'" eds. Emily McGinn, Amy Leggette, Matthew Hannah, and Paul Bellew. *Scholarly Editing: The Annual of the Association for Documentary Editing*, Vol. 35, 2014. Web.
- Hansen’s central intervention on Whitehead’s thought, arguing that, while technology expands the scope for human perception across new sensory environments, it also limits the human’s immediate sensory experience of the world. Mark Hansen offers a provocative framework for thinking about human engagement with twenty-first-century media. It is precisely this exchange between direct and indirect perception that changes my reading of Woolf’s short story. First, on a material level, the edition expands the reader’s access to the text across time, while marginalizing her direct engagement with the witnesses as physical, time-bound objects, as actual books. This tension between the physical and virtual in the edition provokes a further implication on the level of narrative, which complicates Matz’s reading of perceptual unities that drive the narration. Allowing us to expand our perceptual capacities to things we might not directly feel but nonetheless experience, the edition opens up a reading of time as an agent in the story.
- In contrast to the beginning of the story, which locates the action in the past, the interruption here locates the narration in the present, unfolding action, which then leads to a final statement in the past tense. These ambiguities and mergings signal the important role that time plays in mediating the story itself, and especially, in bringing it to a close.

Klein, Lauren F., "The Image of Absence: Archival Silence, Data Visualization, and James Hemings," in *American Literature*, 85 (4): 661–688, 2013. Web.
- The way that Klein approaches her work with the invisible or forgotten is useful here. It’s not about recovering what is absent, of making things present in some way. It’s about tracing the activity, the pathways of connection, networks of communication. 
- “The archive as a site of action rather than as a record of fixity or loss” (665).
- We let ghosts be ghosts. An image of absence. 
- Critique of Ramsay --- there are places where meaning and understanding are impossible. The digital is not just about supplementing subjective hermeneutics with shiny new tools, but about changing the way that we think about the archive, and our understanding of the archival record. 

### Editing

Tanselle, Thomas. "A Rationale of Textual Criticism", 1992. PDF.
- Greg-Bowers-Tanselle are against the tyranny of the copy-text, and think we should be making eclectic editions, being careful and deliberate about our choice and judgment of substantive elements. 
- The textual object is merely a vessel for the text, which is necessarily corrupted in its physical form. 
    - “Those who believe that they can analyze a literary work without questioning the constitution of a particular written or oral text of it are behaving as if the work were directly accessible on paper or in sound waves. … [In fact,] its medium is neither visual nor auditory. The medium of literature is the words (whether already existent or newly created) of a language; and arrangements of words according to the syntax of some language (along with such aids to their interpretation as pauses or punctuation) can exist in the mind, whether or not they are reported by voice or in writing” (16-17).
- His attention to medium of words and paper elides medium of thought---as if the mind is pure thought, not an embodied process. 
- The way he presents the central dilemma of textual criticism----either we pass down what we receive or we correct it---is ultimately conservative and oppressive. How do we maintain without perpetuating? Or recover without overwriting or determining? In other words, how can we open rather than constrain or delimit meaning?

Derrida, Jacques. “Archive Fever: A Freudian Impression.” *Diacritics*, vol. 25, no. 2, 1995. PDF.
- The archive is associated with order and beginnings. Commencement and commandment. Arche, Arke.
- In creating the archive, we open the potential to forget. The externalization of knowledge exposes it to destruction. The archive works against itself.
- The archivization produces as much as it records the event. 
- Technology determines the impression: “It conditions not only the form or the structure which prints, but the printed content of the printing: the pressure of the printing, the impression, before the division between the printed and the printer” (18). 
    - This is the moment proper to the archive. The instant of archivization. “The prosthetic experience of the technical substrate” (22). The impression. 

McKenzie, D.F. *Bibliography and the Sociology of Texts*, 1999. Print.
- Tanselle expands what is admissible. Bibliography is about the social process of transmission. He critiques positivism of bibliographic methods which are analytical or descriptive, which aim to resolve questions of authorial intention or describe physical features. He says we need to promote new knowledge. We need a history of misreading:
    - “Any history of the book---subject as books are to typographic and material change---must be a history of misreadings. This is not so strange as it might sound. Every society rewrites its past, every reader rewrites its texts, and if they have any continuing life at all, at some point every printer redesigns them” (25).
- The tree structure, the trunk being the ideal text (never realized, only hinted at), and the branches being the florid witnesses. The book is never a single object, but a product of a number of human agencies and mechanical techniques that are historically situated. The trunk is the source, the animating principle (the “text”) that flows into the branches, witnesses. All these witnesses imply an ideal form never fully realized. 

McGann, Jerome. *Radiant Textuality: Literature after the World Wide Web*, 2001. Print.
- McGann introduces the term “quantum poetics” to indicate the volatile potentiality for meaning contained in every element of a literary text. He explains that: 
    - “Aesthetic space is organized like quantum space, where the ‘identity’ of the elements making up the space are perceived to shift and change, even reverse themselves, when measures of attention move across discrete quantum levels” (184). 
- IOW, the meaning of particular words in a literary text depends upon a multitude of factors, from antecedent readings and pathways through that text, to the significance of immanent elements such as typography and blank spaces, all of which the reader can only process a limited amount. 
In its potentiality, McGann asserts, “Every page, even a blank page… is n-dimensional.” Spatial units are opportunities for non-lexical expression. 
- Science vs Poetry
    - He clarifies that there is a difference between editorial/archival projects (which treat text as information) and hermeneutic/analytical projects that treat the reading process and interpretation (treat text as recursive aesthetic elements). Though our current tools, SGML/TEI, serve informational purposes, McGann is excited about the potential of XML (TEI, SGML). Hypertext exists before the web.  We need tools that function as prosthetic extensions. 
    - SGML cannot capture poetics, “the recursive patterns that constitute an essential… feature of poetry” (172).

Singer, Kate. “[Digital Close Reading: TEI for Teaching Poetic Vocabularies](https://jitp.commons.gc.cuny.edu/digital-close-reading-tei-for-teaching-poetic-vocabularies/).” *The Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy* 3, May 15, 2013. 
- Uses encoding as a method of teaching close reading in the English classroom. “The painstaking process of selecting bits of text and wrapping them with tags reframed reading as slow, iterative, and filled with formal choices."
- Encoding brings us to rethink our strategies/tools for close reading:
    - “Their decisions about which structures and information to tag very much determine what they value in a document—or at least what should be preserved and codified for other readers.”
    - “Since TEI is, at heart, an analytical and descriptive language for the humanities, it might encourage us to rethink which labels, categories, and values are essential in contemporary literary criticism and which terms may be unhelpfully ideological in our efforts to analyze literary texts.”

Caughie, Emily Datskou and Rebecca Parker, “Storm Clouds on the Horizon: Feminist Ontologies and the Problem of Gender,” *Feminist Modernist Studies*, 1:3, 230-242, 2018. Web.
- This is an application of McGann’s comments about incommensurability. The TEI won’t allow them to assign multiple genders to one identity, in order to mark a mid-text gender shift.
- The questioning of the computer leads to the questioning of gender!
Can computational models ever capture such taxonomic chaos of gender ontology? AND “Can ontologies ever capture the complex, multi-layered, dynamic nature of gender identities?”
- We don’t need a solution. We need a way of showing dynamicity while still being findable. The issue with ontology should remain unresolved. That confusion is part of the experience of gender and sexuality in the modernist era. They ended up with a storm cloud, showing clusters of different gender traits over time. 

## Theories of Perception

Hume
- Allows us to see Reason as Speculation, a guess that becomes a habit or custom. Reason builds from the idea or memory which is never as strong as the impression. 

W. James
- Reason is feeling, sentiment of rationality, of things feeling "right" or of knowing their parts. 
Language cannot articulate feelings, it can only articulate images, resting places of feelings. But language can cast a halo, a feeling of tendency, which dies in the moment of its full articulation. This is why conjunctions and prepositions are so important.

Merleau-Ponty
- Our perception/body cannot extricate itself from the world in order to be conscious of that world. It weaves together the real and the imaginary.

Whitehead
- We perceive through *prehension*, seizing data and speculating upon it; we seize data as potentialized, not as actualized. "At an instant there is nothing."
Language is always an abstraction, which is why philosophy needs poetry. 

Bergson
- Memory has to do with storage and access---we recreate sensations from memory. 
Perception is a site of resistance against stimuli---the body is the surface where light is cast. 

Nagel
- Our experience provides the basic material for imagination, but only from our perspective. We cannot know what it's like for a bat to be a bat, only imagine what it's like for a human to have wings, sonar, etc. We cannot explain consciousness in objective terms.

Chalmers & Clark
- The mind extends into the world. Touching objects is thinking with them, incorporating them into a larger cognitive process.

Shaviro
- Non-correlational sentience---contact at a distance---"things move us, force us to feel them" (8). Rather than try to know things, we feel them. We can know things because we are constantly *becoming* (Whitehead) with them. 

Hayles, Unthought
- A "planetary cognitive ecology" extends the focus of ethical inquiry from humans to machines that operate with humans within "cognitive assemblages." What if we distinguished cognition by interpretation or choice, rather than free will?

Varela & Thompson
- Building off Merleau-Ponty---the world isn't pregiven or representational, but enacted. The mind is a cognitive process that links sensory-motor perception to action. 

Damasio
- There are three layers to consciousness---the protoself, core consciousness, and extended consciousness---through which neural patterns filter upward to feelings. Our feelings are elusive because the higher mind filters out what is going on in the body and brain. 
- Primal feelings, which arise from an evolutionary imperative in the brain stem, leads to an "autobiographical self" to manage those feelings.
- Mental processes find parallels in computation:
    - In memory, the brain stores patterns of feeling and a formula to retrieve them.
    - Simulations and hallucinations are recircuiting/tricking the brain to make a feeling.
    - Neurons are electrical and function through polarities.

Malabou
- The way that contemporary neurosciences characterize brain plasticity as flexible, malleable, adaptable plays into late capitalist ideology that conceptualizes humans as self-controlled, autonomous, accountable in their labor. We should reconcieve brain plasticity as explosive, taking charge of our own malleability and resisting the status quo. 

Noe
- Our consciousness is not neuronal or embodied, it is enworlded and enacted. This is a reverse-assemblage (Hayles), everything becomes a tool of human agency.

Dahaene
- We inherit from apes the neuronal structures to process letters.
- Computational metaphors for reading: Visual uptake (saccedes) and word recognition relies on massive parallel processing, but goes way beyond what OCR can do. 

LeDoux
- By examining what happens to the prefrontal and parietal cortices during vision, we find them necessary for consciousness. Whatever else is going on, the neocortex is necessary.

Pitts-Taylor
- Scientific conceptions of the brain are limited---they reify the ideologies of heteronormativity, ableism, racism, disguising them as biological truths. What about bodily differences?
- There are limits to identification---mirror neurons make misreadings. 

Tougaw
- Literature is a mode that can usefully speculate beyond the explanatory gap to questions of qualia and selfhood. Brain narratives offer simulations of qualia, allowing us to ask questions that laboratory sciences are not able to answer. 
- Literature substitutes particularity for reductionism, speculative worlds for hypothesis. Neuronovelists dramatize epistemological questions without answering them, allowing us to feel the porousness of the explanatory gap.

Turing
- Not asking whether computers can think, but whether computers can perform thinking, function in a way that imitates thought. 
- Learning compared to programming---the role of ignorance and suprise. 

Haraway
- In arguing for a new feminist science, that de-naturalizes the natural, Haraway proposes the cyborg, overcoming essentialism and appropriating technological determinism.
- Cyborg language is the struggle against perfect communication.

Powers
- Can computers simulate thought? What is the relation between thought and feeling in computation?

Hayles, Posthuman
- When did information lose its body, and how is this tied to the liberalization of the human subject?
- Is gender embodied?

Wilson
- The coassembly of machines and emotion is one of the foundations of the artificial sciences (AI).

## Queer Subjects and Affects

### Protomodernist Aestheticizations

Wilde, Oscar. The Picture of Dorian Gray. 1890, 1891 & MS.

MS & 1890: 
- Wilde codes or obscures references to homosexuality and homoeroticism---the deep intimacy between Lord Henry and Basil; removes suggestsion in Basil's devotion of fatality and intensity toward Dorian; frames Dorian as an aesthetic rather than erotic object.
    - The first chapter: 
        - Suppresses intimacy between Lord Henry and Basil, touching, shaking off hands.
        - Neutralizes or replaces tense mood or dramatic interactions wit playful banter and laughter---no low voices, switches murmurs for laughs; "look of pain" to "perplexity"; "look" to "glance"; "passion" to "feeling"; "mad" to "reckless".
        - Tense or confessional tone becomes confusion or exasperation. 
        - Dorian's abstract allure becomes rerouted toward specific attributes; he becomes an aesthetic rather than erotic object---"beauty" to "personality", or "good looks"; "extraordinary romance" to "curious artistic idolatry". 
        - Basil's fatal obsession becomes an aesthetic devotion. 
        - Basil's suffering/jealousy about Dorian is completely cut.
- Disagreement about the "Moral":
    - While critics thought that the story celebrates hedonistic lifestyles, Wilde asserts that the story condemns "excess and renunciation", and that this moral was "too obvious". In letters to the editor, defending the his work, Wilde discusses the need to suppress the "obvious moral"---"that all excess, as well as all renunciation, brings about its own punishment" (Letter to St. James Gazette). He says the existence of the moral is an artistic error. 
    - Wilde then begins the process of revising the novel so that the didactic is subordinated to the aesthetic. He is turned from an erotic to an aesthetic object.
    - When I was 16 I read this book as an encouragement to hedonism. It made me obsessed with youth and beauty. Now when I reread the book in my twenties I see that the moral is about the dangers of living a closeted lifestyle. Lord Henry is not telling Dorian to be vain, but telling him to embrace his sexual awakening, to not let society shame him into hiding. 

1891: 
Dorian becomes thoroughly corrupt, the ending rewritten so he appears monstrous and with no remorse. The middle parts, the subplot with James Vane, was added to make Dorian more of a villain.

Pater, Walter. Studies of the History of the Renaissance. 1873.
- For Pater, criticism is an individual sensation, an 'impressionist' mode, an erotic encounter between subject and object, past and present. He goes against criticism as an act of intellectual apprehension (Ruskin & Arnold). He was looking to Renaissance artists (Botticelli) who in turn looked to Hellenistic ideas to heal the rupture between body and mind. 
    - The *Studies* an attempt to educate the senses, sensibility to experience aesthetics as an erotic encounter. This ultimately positions the viewer as a recepticle for impressions. Pater's is an *aesthetics of the bottom*. Aesthetic appreciation is being receptive to the forces of beauty emanating from the object. This is an erotic experience. You need to be the bottom, rather than the top (like Arnold and Ruskin, objectivist, intellectual). 
- His prose is driven and dripping with affect---longing, nostalgia, eroticism. 
    - "Painful sense of aspiration". 
    - "penetrate"; "discriminate"; :power of being deeply moved"; "susceptibility"; recepticle"; "curious"; "does it give me pleasure?"
    - "charm of ascesis: of the austere and serious girding of the loins in youth" (5). A self restraint that makes one more sensitive, more discriminating. 
- Michaelangelo:
    - "No one ever expressed more truly than Michaelangelo the notion of inspired sleep, of faces charged with dreams" (44).
- Leonardo:
    - "Through his strange veil of sight things reach him so; in no ordinary night or day, but as in faint light of eclipse, or in some brief interval of falling rain at daybreak, or through deep water. And not into nature only; but he plunged also into human personality and became above all a painter of portraits; faces of a modelling more skilful than has been seen before or since, embodied with a reality which almost amounts to illusion on dark air" (63).
- Botticelli: 
    - "He paints the story of the goddess of pleasure in other episodes besides that of her birth from the sea, but never without some shadow of death in the grey flesh and wan flowers. He paints Madonnas, but they shrink from the pressure of the divine child, and plead in unmistakable undertones for a warmer, lower humanity" (34).
        - "The light is indeed cold—mere sunless dawn; but a later painter would have cloyed you with sunshine; and you can see the better for that quietness in the morning air each long promontory, as it slopes down to the water's edge. Men go forth to their labours until the evening; but she is awake before them, and you might think that the sorrow in her face was at the thought of the whole long day of love yet to come....Botticelli meant all that imagery to be altogether pleasurable; and it was partly an incompleteness of resources, inseparable from the art of that time, that subdued and chilled it; but his predilection for minor tones counts also; and what is unmistakable is the sadness with which he has conceived the goddess of pleasure, as the depositary of a great power over the lives of men" (31).

Field, Michael. Sight and Song. 1892. 
- Written by collaborative poets, Edith Cooper and Katherine Bradley, writing together as Michael Field. Consists of 31 "picture-poems" or ekphrastic exercises, on famous paintings from the Italian Renaissance in galleries across Western Europe. The poems range in form, but seem to all be variations of sonnets.
- Ekphrastic exercise:
    - The poems resist and critique Victorian ideologies about women by reclaiming previously objectified female subjectivity. This is proto-queer and proto-feminist. They anticipate feminist/queer strategies of seeing. They play the instability of language against the apparent stability of images; using poetry to "revise" rather than "describe" paintings. Interestingly, contemporary reviews thought the poems too descriptive, that they describe the paintings in too much detail as to rob poetry of its creative spirit. Like a guidebook or catalogue in verse. ("every detail of the picture is most insisted upon").
- I read these poems not as exercises in subjective withholding (Pater) but as exercises in inquiry, where the viewer interrogates and therefore destabilizes the popular stories and themes they represent. The speaker in the poems imagines new narratives to replace the old ones of female objectivity and passivity. They shift perspectives to overturn implied and normalized ideologies of objectification. A woman's rescue is turned into a man's; a scene of rape is turned into a scene of appreciating sexless beauty. Language unsettles the image, making its narrative assumptions explicit and revising them. We ought to read the poems first then look at the paintings. 
- Tintoretto's "The Rescue" --- shows Arsinoe fleeing from the seige of Alexandria. In the poem, Arsinoe achieves agency and control over her own naked body, which she uses to stablize the man "rescuing" her who is dazzled by her beauty, "maintains his form"; as well as using nakedness to overcome her physical restraints: "her bondage irks not"; shortening the title to the "rescue" rather than "rescue of arsinoe" makes the object of rescue ambiguous. 
- Correggio's "Antiope" --- while the painting presents a clear scene of voyeurism, the poem nearly omits Zeus's presence, and casts him as a curious appreciatior of Antiope's beauty rather than a rapist. In removing her cloak, Zeus covers her body with visual admiration. His gaze precludes sexual desire, and she retains the innocence of her sleepy state, which is the main focus of the poem. A visual admiration distinct from sexual desire "love's flambeau dies". Revises a myth of rape to a scene of loveliness, tenderness, admiration: "beauty franchised".
