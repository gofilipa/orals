# Daily Dissertation


## December 19

I need to update on my meeting with Wayne last week, but that will have to wait for another day. First, I'm going through my Perception list one more time before my meeting with Jason tomorrow. Over the past two days, I've made some dramatic (necessary?) changes to this list. I cut out a whole lot of works and consolidated subtopics. The survivors are:
- Posthumanism & Bodies: Haraway, Hayles, Elizabeth Wilson & Richard Powers
- Cognition & Computation: Various 20thC essays, Varela, Damasio, Chalmers, Dahaene, Hayles & Alain Robbe-Grillet or Jason Tougaw
- Colors & Emotions: Newton, Goethe, Wittgenstein & & Julie Delport
- Empiricism: Hume, Bergson, W. James, Merleau-Ponty & Moretti and Boone
- Speculative Realism: Whitehead, Stengers, Shaviro & Santiago Ramon y Cajal

The total comes out to just under 30. This seems about right. There are other concerns, things I may want to add (or swap in):
- a feminist perspective---most of these works (excepting the Posthuman section) are written by men, and gender perhaps ought to factor into the Cognition, Empiricism, and Speculative Realism sections. 
- a list of "greatest works" of literary criticism that engages with cognitive studies/themes/models. They might be proto-cognitive---not directly engaging or empoying cognition, but evocative or resonant of it. Specifically, I'm thinking of work by Boone or Tougaw. 
- potentially, add a list of "neuronovels" or "brain memoirs", as Tougaw calls them. 

Okay, now that those issues are out of the way, I can begin to examine this list, subtopic by subtopic, to get a sense of the questions that I am asking of them, and how they fit into the whole.

**Posthumanism & Bodies**
- How do historical and scientific discourses about technology address the body, emotions, affects, and gender?
- What is the relationship between the analogy of machine/body and software(code)/mind? How is this embodied by the posthuman and cyborg?

**Cognition & Computation**
- How is thinking like computation? What is the historical understanding of this relationship?
- Where is consciousness located---in the mind, body, or somewhere else?

**Colors & Affect**
- What is the historical understanding of the *location* of color? In the mind, eye, object, or light?
- What is the relationship between color and affect? How do certain colors or color combinations engage emotions?

**Empiricism**
- How do we understand the historical emergence and development of empiricism?
- How does W. James and Merleau-Ponty begin to trouble the empiricist notions of observation, experimentation, falsification, with the presumption of a rational and authoritative mind?

**Speculative Realism**
- What are the terms of the debate between Speculative Realism and Correlationism?
- How is *knowing* an *aesthetic* experience? What is the role of emotion and affect in knowing?
- How do the conclusions of Speculative Realism play out against the issues of cognition vs computation, the location of consciousness, and the role of affect in perception, as explored in my other subtopics?

I made an interesting change in my Digital Studies list, which has also bled into my Theories of Perception and the Mind list: instead of having a separate section of primary works (such as science/hyper -fiction and digital archives), what if I add those works individually to the end of each subtopic, as a kind of "demonstration" of the critical interventions made therein? For example, *Woolf Online* and *Infinite Ulysses* move to the **Editing** subtopic, and *Galatea 2.2* goes to the **Posthuman** section. These creative pieces will then become weekend reads, with a lower pressure. 

## December 8

Earlier this week, I met with Matt to talk about my digital list. The meeting went very well--he was totally supportive and encouraging of my choices so far, and seemed to appreciate what I could explain about my project. 

He helped me to cut out some works, to add a few more, and to consider strategies for approaching the exam. His specific suggestions include
- Despite one of my research questions being about gender/queerness, this list is really missing texts on those topics. Some suggestions that address this
    * consider *Data Feminism* (draft published online) by Lauren Klein. 
    * consider article by Laura Mandell in forthcoming *Debates*, about TEI & binaries.
    * consider either "Queer OS" article by Jacob Gaboury (in 2016 *Debates*), or the more extensive chapter in Routledge's *Media Studies* collection, edited by Sayers. 
- In my **Methods** subtopic, consider swapping Drucker's book for the essay, "Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display".
    * Whatever additional gender/queer focused text should probably go in this subtopic as well. 
- In **Networks,** take out *The Exploit* (I already have two other Galloways).
    * move *Protocol* from **Language** to **Networks**. 
- In **Editing, Editions, and Archives**, add McKenzie, D.F., *Bibliography and the Sociology of Texts,* 1999.
- In **Science/Hyper -Fiction**, maybe remove one of the novels. 
- Consider working with Karl Steel, who does Speculative Philosophy and Posthumanism. 
- You should approach these texts as ideas that you can push off of---using one to talk about the other. 
- Think about what questions you're trying to answer with each subtopic. Try to narrow the interest and curiosity down.

***

These suggestions have prompted me down a slightly distracted two days of reading... after which I have made the following decisions:

First, from my **Media** section, I took out *Paper Knowledges* by Gitelman, which I feel a bit guilty about (it seems a fascinating book), but it doesn't directly address my interests in media about *computation* and transcriptions into digital forms... as well as storage and memory and futurity. The remaining books on the list are more important. 

I added a different article by Jacob Gaboury (which he kindly alerted me to in an email), published recently in  *Women and Performance*, to my **Language** section.

Finally, after reading through Laura Mandell's article, which was good, I decided it was too much about big data for my focus. So I will add (instead) an article by Pamela Caughie (et al) on the difficulty of encoding gender ontologies. This will also replace Kenneth Goldsmith's book on *Uncreative Writing*, in my **Editing** subtopic.

## December 3

So now I turn to my digital list--to Matt's question--what do I want to get out of this list?

1) Technology and gender: how technology "reads" or "encodes" gender. How the binairies and abstractions of computation struggle or fail to register the complexity of embodied human experience.

2) The discipline/methods/hermeneutics: how digital methods encourage play and speculation, the role of subjectivity built into criticism that cannot be "corrected" by computation ("distant" reading is just like close reading). Computation and creativity.

3) Technology and the nonverbal/affective: how can technology/digital tools engage nonverbal/preverbal/affective qualities or responses about literature; more pointedly, how do digitization/methods engage *embodied* reading practices?

## November 30

Queer Modernism list:

Need to cut--Theories of Gender, Sexuality and Race AND Queer Affects subtopics to 10 books maximum, and combine them into one master queer theory subtopic. The plus and minuses indicate whether the work has been added or cut from my list. 

Foundations--texts about women's silence/repression in writing?

\+ "Laugh of the Medusa" \
\- *Disidentifications* \
\- *Gender Trouble* (keeping *Bodies that Matter*) 

Prologue--*affects*?

\- Boone, *Libidinal Currents* \
\- Sedgwick, *Touching Feeling* (but keeping chapter on "Shame") \
\- Ahmed, *Queer Phenomenology* & *Promise of Happiness* \
\- Berlant & Edelman, "Sex, or the Unbearable" 

I really don't feel great about a lot of these cuts. There are things that I want to read on here. But I need to remember that I cannot read everything, shouldn't try to read everything, but only to read things that will be relevant to MY project, which cannot be comprehensive. So I've chosen to keep works that have most directly to do with the themes/issues that my project will treat. **What are the major affects related to queerness? What about writing or reading sexuality and gender?** The texts must be able to speak to these questions. 

The final list for Queer Modernisms:

### Foundations
- Rich, Adrienne. "When We Dead Awaken: Writing as Revision", 1979.
- Cixous, Helen. "The Laugh of the Medusa", 1975.

- Sedgwick, Eve Kosofsky. *The Epistemology of the Closet*, 1990.
- Butler, Judith. *Bodies That Matter*, 1993. 

### Affects
- Bersani, Leo. “Is the Rectum a Grave?” 1987.
- Cvetkovich, Ann. *An Archive of Feelings: Trauma, Sexuality, and Lesbian Public Cultures*, 2003.
- Sedgwick, Eve Kosofsky. Chapter on "Shame" from *Touching Feeling: Affect, Pedagogy, Performativity*, 2003.
- Muñoz, José. *Cruising Utopia: The Then and There of Queer Futurity*, 2009.
- Love, Heather. *Feeling Backward: Loss and the Politics of Queer History*, 2009.

### Protomodernist Aestheticizations
- Wilde, Oscar. *The Picture of Dorian Gray*, 1890 and 1891, and MS.
- Pater, Michael. *Studies of the History of the Renaissance*.
- Field, Michael. *Sight and Song*, 1892.

### Modernist Auto/biography and Journals
- Woolf, Virginia. *Orlando*, 1928.
- Woolf, Virginia. *A Writer's Diary*, 1953.
- Woolf, Virginia. "A Sketch of the Past", 1939.
- Stein, Gertrude. "Q.E.D.", 1903 and *Three Lives*, 1909. 
- Barnes, Djuna. *Nightwood*, 1936.
- Mansfield, Katherine and Margaret Scott. *The Katherine Mansfield Notebooks*, 2002.

### Postmodern Memoir-esque

- Baldwin, James. *Giovanni's Room*, 1956.
- Anzaldua, Gloria. *Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza*, 1987.
- Myles, Eileen. *Chelsea Girls*, 1994.

- Rosenberg, Jordy. *Confessions of the Fox*, 2018.

## November 28

Spent some time today cutting down the literary readings for Queer Modernisms: *protomodernism*, *modernist auto/biography*, and *postmodern memoir*. 

The things I CUT:
- Colette, *Pure and the Impure*
- Feinberg, *Stone Butch Blues*
- Delany, *Motion of Light in Water*
- Wittig, *Les Guerilleres*
- Woolf, short stories (from *Monday or Tuesday)
- Stein, *Autobiography of Alice* & *Tender Buttons*
- Nelson, *Bluets* & *Argonauts*

The things I ADDED:
- Stein, *Q.E.D.* & *Three Lives*
- Woolf, "Sketch of the Past"
- Rosenberg, *Confessions of the Fox*

Things that SURVIVED:
- Myles, *Chelsea Girls*
- Baldwin, *Giovanni's Room*
- Mansfield, *Complete Journals*, ed. Margaret Scott

A few notes on some of these decisions:

Concerning Mansfield---I was going to take her out completely (she's about 700 pages long!), but the journal has been such a delight to read (though a slog to carry around). And she's clearly some kind of queer---speaking about women in passionate, consicously sexual terms. There's a vitality to her language (which I've mentioned about her letters(!) and short stories)---a darkness mixed with lightthat I find irresistible. Able to read for 700 pages. Then there's the compelling voice of the editor (transcriber!), Margaret Scott, in the footnotes. She revises John Middleton Murray's previous editorial work (overwriting and censorsop), and her voice comes through in a lovely soft way. 

Stone Butch Blues---This one was difficult to drop. The fear of identification/disidentification---the tension between them---runs strong here. I know that personally this is a book I *have to read*, but intellectually and aesthetically it's not as compelling to me as others which I'd rather keep on my list. It made me cry. It's too raw, not particularly literary. "My stone self". The most unmediated narrative on the list. Is this interesting? Art?

Giovanni's Room---beautifully written first page. Therefore stays.

After cutting down these texts, some things become quite clear. My project is really invested in editing and editorial practices. The footnotes are important. The mediations and fictionalities are important. This is why Woolf's short stories have to go and "Sketch of the Past" takes their place. Why *Stone Butch Blues* has to go, and *Chelsea Girls* must stay. Why Mansfield and Rosenberg are on there, too. (Still unsure about Maggie Nelson, TBH. I do love *Bluets*)

Significantly, this means that I can cut down my secondary reaings to fit this more streamlined focus. 

## November 7

Today I spent a couple of hours cutting down my "Theories of Perception + Mind" list. Got rid of a lot of things that I either didn't want to read or seemed unnecessary. These past couple of weeks have really made me realize that (1) I'm dealing with too many texts and ideas and (2) I already have something solid---a question---that I want to pursue so I don't need to plan for reading to search for a question. 

What is the question? Well, I can't quite phrase it at this point. But it has something to do with how digital tools engage queer affects in a way that is embodied (through the body) which includes the mind; and part of this is an examination of how perception and thinking and feeling work, on a biological level, and how that compares to computational processes---or alterntively, how computational reveal or inform how thinking/feeling/perception work. This list---theories of perception and the mind---is what will guide that latter component. 

So---to try and put it succintly---looking at what computation reveals about perception---perceptual processes and emotions---and seeing how digital tools can engage or play with these connections---specifically in the digitization of queer and autobiographical modes of writing/creativity. Does that help? I'm not sure it does. 

Anyway, to recap the work today, where I got rid of the following subtopics:
- Affect + technology
- Color theory
- Empiricism
- Ecocriticism

The most important texts from these lists have migrated to other subtopics. So the current subtopics include:
- the Posthuman Body
- Vision
- Cognition (and emotion)
- Philosophies of mind + Empiricism
- Speculative Realism
- [and literature... "neuronovels"?]

Major decisions here include fusing "Affect and tech" to the "Posthuman body"; significantly cutting down the contents of Vision + Cognition (*Micrographia* had to go), fusing the Philosophy lists (they really present one trajectory on a question---which is historical and goes from Aristotle to Whitehead), and keeping Speculative Realism (because it's current and extremely interesting to me). There's still the literature section---not sure what will go here. Maybe memoirs about the brain, "neuronovels", as Jason Tougaw calls them.

On the bus ride home today I also came to another decision about scheduling and list limits. 
1. Each list will contain a maximum of 25 works. Because I don't want to kill myself.
2. There will be 5 subtopics with an average of 5 books each or 6 subtopics with an average of 4 books each (one subtopic containing 5 books).
3. I will allow myself (assuming the exam is on May 15) 4.5 months (18 weeks) to study. January 7 (monday) to May 15.
4. Given these limits, I will allow 5 books (or one subtopic) per week. One book for each week way. On the weekends I will synthesize the most important points, keeping it short and to the point. One paragraph per book with notes on moments of interest. 
5. Therefore, the schedule allows 5 weeks for each list, and runs accordingly: 
    - Jan 7-Feb 10 (Digital list); 
    - Feb 11-March 17 (Perception/Consciousness); 
    - March 18-April 19 (Queer Mod); 
    - April 22-May 14 (Review); 
    - May 15: exam.

I think this pacing will give me the structure and space that I need in order to do what is necessary. 

## October 30: meeting with Wayne

*Asking you to be part of my committee...*

“Queer Modernisms” or “queer modernisms and affects”. Contains mostly modernist fiction and journals, postmodern memoir and experimental writing, with some theory on sexuality/race, gender, queer studies.

Topics include:
Theories of Gender, Sexuality, and Race 
Queer Affects
Protomodernism (Wilde, Walter Pater, and Henry James)
Modernist Fiction/Life Writing (Stein, Woolf, Barnes, Isherwood)
Postmodern Memoir (Barthes, Baldwin, Delany, Myles, Bechde)
Experimental Writing / Journals (Mansfield and Woolf… and more)

Methodology is digital (this is my main field of study---digital humanities). I’m interested in the digital insofar as it facilitates new ways of reading, new hermeneutical models based on speculation and play, (possible through computer) but also in difficulty of using technology (which is dominated by logics, computation, abstractions) to engage the complexities and ambiguities of literature.
* Encoding (“tagging” different elements of a text like identity, affect). The difficulty of categorizing or “encoding” queer IDs.
* Textual analysis (using computation to mine for affect / sentiment analysis) Also known as “distant reading”. 
* Processes of digitization and how new formats change the way we read, attuned to previously overlooked qualities about the text.  
* Pedagogical aspect --- teaching close reading --- annotation tools. How can digital annotation engage nonverbal responses to text? What is the role of the nonverbal in learning to close-read?

My questions:
* In what ways do technologies of digitization and mediation facilitate new interpretations or readings?
* What digital tools or methods engage the complexities of queer affect and identity? 
* How can digital methods engage nonverbal or affective responses to reading? (this is a pedagogical question)

Wayne's Comments:
* When considering the “Theories of Gender/Sex/Race” and “Queer Affects” list, don’t think too much in binary terms. Don’t have this stark division in my mind, because they aren’t as divided. 
* Restore Adrienne Rich’s two essays from “Rejects”.
* Maybe move Bersani… 
* Some of the lists look a bit short. Consider “Protomodernism”, where you should add Michael Field. 
* Some of the lists can be combined. Like Postmodern Memoir and Experimental Writing. Combine those into “Autobiographical and Experimental Writing”
* Avoid problematic binaries.
* What would be the effect of keeping the “Rejects”, as a kind of silent chorus? 
* Structured reading time. 
* Learning to speak with poise, the complexity about things you are reading. Emphasize the positive parts of this process, not the stress. 
* Jason Tougaw’s article about Pedagogy in Wayne’s class. 
* The last week of classes is an ideal time---definitely before the last day of class. 

***
coming at this a few hours later... I had a revelation on the subway. What if I took seriously Wayne's comments about the "Rejects" acting as a chorus (that is, as actors who do not affect the primary action). What if I re-consider the way that I'm organizing this list, with groupings that are *preformative* instead of *descriptive*? To run with the example of Greek plays, I could have a group of texts that form a "prologue", others that represent various "episodes".... or to follow Shakespearean structure, the five parts from "exposition" to "denouement". 

## October 24

Again revisiting QM list. The revelation of doing journals as a focus still has an encouraging effect on me. (though Wayne still hasn't written back, which keeps me anxious...).

I'm revising my High Modernist Fiction list to "Modernist Autobiography". It seems to me that many of these works are actually autobiographical, to a certain extent:
- Orlando
- The Autobiography of Alice B Toklas
- Colette
- Nightwood
- Isherwood

There's a thin line between reality and fiction. That these stories draw from life. Others in this list which do not fit so nicely:
- Jacob's Room
- Well of Loneliness
- K. Mansfield's short stories

So what to do about this? Keep them as anomalies? Or maybe... and this excites me... after I'm done delineating all the autobiographical stuff I'll be left with all of these kind of unbelievable and fantastical novels that make up their own genre. The outcasts will form their own classification, their own community, in other words.

This idea of Modernist Autobiography comes to me from Georgia Johnson's Formation of Modernist lesbian Autobiography, which has a helpful introduction. The topic of autobiography is paramount. Because it brings into question the function of identity --writing subjects in relation to the intended audience---something that is always interesting to me. It enhances the role of the speaking "I". The difficulty of categorizing, encoding queer identities.

Question---What hapens when you combine the encoding of queer identity and nonverbal annotion or engaging emotion/affect of the reader?
- how does affect relate to identity?
- how does what I feel when I read relate to the identities embedded in the text?

In the "Torment of Queer Literature", the writer talks about identification through negative emotions---shame, terror, panic, stigma. The fear of reading yourself into the characters. The isolation of doing so. The fear when you encounter a mirror of your pain and suffering. The fear of being represented and not represented. The fear of finding yourself on the page as a marginalized subject.

## October 20

It's been a while. I've been anxious about my Queer Modernisms list. I feel that I really ought to be developing a focus at this point. From what I've been hearing lately, and a perspective that I'm trying to adopt, is that I just need to finish the damn thing. I need to really start conceiving of my dissertation not as an impending revelation but as an imminent project. I need to pursue what I know I already like, what is within my reach.

What do I already like? I like notebooks, journals, histories of composition, speculation, the potentials of form. 

*Histories of composition* (Now I will revise my QM list to reflect this focus.)

Joseph Allen Boone's *Libidinal Currents* --- the affect of close reading.
Csvetkovitch *An Archive of Feelings* --- "acting out" as an archive, as a public act.

Feelings of impending rejection from my desired committee members. I feel fundamentally lost. But also realizing that I'm so much stronger, smarter, have gone futher than I give myself credit for. 

What is within my reach? This interest in journals, in composing. I'm interested in the first draft. The pen against paper, momentum, the errata of daily life, the sunlight against paper. In archives, histories, real stories. 

Question --- in what ways do technologies of digitization and mediation facilitate new interpretations/readings of this kind of work?

I've just removed many works from my Theory, Protomodernism, and High Modernism topcs. Removing novels by James, Cther, which I either haven't read or don't sense that they will be terribly interesting to me. That is to say that I am focusing. Narrowing down. Aiming for things already within my reach; and it feels good.

## July 26

So this is my second day of working on the digital list. So far I have researched three sub-topics: 
* methods --- includes scientific method and digital and digital textuality and theories of reading, hermeneutics
* networks --- internet cables, wireless networks, social media, histories of the internet, cloud, communications and network theory
* language --- hypertext studies, hypertext/cyber fiction, reading/writing on the machine, programming languages and poetics. 

You can see that these topics aren’t very tight. Things get a bit more complex with my media section. There’s a fine line between paper/print/digital formats and then of programming languages. Media I’ll approach more as media archaeology. And as vitality. Though this line of vitality in media also runs through language. I think these distinctions will work themselves out. 

I’m including Caitlin Fisher’s *These Waves of Girls* because I love it and it’s had such a big influence on me / hypertext writing. Wish I could find more works like that one… 

This list is in many ways the one I’m most excited about. It’s foundational. The ideas are the reason that I’ve wanted to study literature at the PhD level. 

Books like Galloway’s *Protocol* or Ramsay’s *Reading Machines* excite me like no other. There is so much potential to be had. A whole terrain of feeling that underlies the way we use technology and the books that we read. My dissertation aims to uncover these embedded feelings. Not that they are hiding (*not* a hermeneutics of suspicion) but that the are there, waiting to be felt, if only one can approach them from a position of ignorance, defamiliarization, speculation. A hermeneutics of wonder… A speculative method.

## July 24

Back at this. 

Last week (yesterday) I finished (sort of) my Queer Modernisms list. So far, it feels much less coherent than the theories of perception. I have two main categories of criticism --- sex, gender, and race & queer affects/temporalities. But then things become more eclectic. The literature is divided into four categories:

* Protomodernism --- Pater, Wilde, James, and Vernon Lee? 
* Modernism --- Woolf, Barnes, Stein, Mansfield, Isherwood!, Hall, Colette
* Postmodernism --- Baldwin?, Feinburg?, Highsmith, Waters (things are getting very eclectic)
* Experimental Writing / Autobio / Manus --- Mansfield, Woolf, Delany, Bechdel, Myles… 

I want to trace affects in queer writing. I want to use technology to trace affects in queer writing. 

Many of these books are sad, depressing, but that’s a major part of being queer! There’s also the anger. There’s also the sense of being out of time. 

I think I need to step up my memoir game. 

Now I actually feel better about this. My queer modernisms list is all about feeling queer --- what it means to feel queer. How we can examine/exhume new ways of being queer?

I need to look at more notebooks. I also need to add more visual memoir and life writing. 

## July 15

Today I took it a little easy. I worked on my Queer Affects list. Though I’m changing the title to Queer Affects and Time. Not only are the common topics among the works, but I also think that they are means of connection or vitality in queer writing. 

So one of the problems is distinguishing this list from the Sex, Gender, and Race list alongside it. Right now I’m conceiving the break as temporal. That is, that many of the arguments and texts actually belong in Sex, Gender, Race but that there was a development of thought more toward emotion, affect, time. So that’s one way of distinguishing them. That Affect Theory is a natural or logical outgrowth of feminist critique, of queer critique. I know nothing about queerness. Or affect. I really need to spend more time reading criticism on it. 

## July 13

The Queer Modernisms list is going well. I’ve set a scheme for topics:

* Theories of gender, sexuality, race
* Queer Affects
* Fiction (incl protomodernist, high modernist, post modern, autobio & experimental writing
* Journals / Diaries / manuscripts
* Womens’ writing theories

This gives me a bit of anxiety, but I think it will go well. Today I honed down “theories” and tomorrow I will do “affects”. I think I need a whole week---next week---to shape the “fiction” section, and journals/diaries/manus.

## July 11

Day three of my Queer Modernisms list. And I don’t feel as if I’ve accomplished enough. Still in the stage of assembling and collecting readings, adding things that I’ll have to vet later, probably too much and it’s too early to see what kind of shape it will take. 

There are a few categories that I’m sure of:

* Queer Theory --- includes some race, futurity, as well as greatest hits like Foucault, Butler, Halberstam, etc.
* Fiction --- Decadence (Wilde, Rachilde, Fields?); High Modernism (Woolf, Barnes, Stein, Mansfield, Cather?); Postmodernism (Baldwin?, Delany?, Moraga?)
* Autobiography --- Delany, Bechdel, Myles, Edmund White, Barthes, Colette?, Anzaldua
* Lesbian pulp / classics ?
* Women Writers Criticism --- Shari Benstock
* Literary Theory ?

Maybe my postmodern list can be specified as “postmodern autobiography” or “memoir” or “life writing”.

I’m really only interested in modernist *fiction* and postmodern *nonfiction* or *memoir*. Woolf’s Orlando being the fulcrum between those two. This idea actually really excites me. Maybe I can also include Wilde and Rachilde into the modern… though this would destroy the woman focus. 

As I was reading *Well of Loneliness* today I also had another thought about the distinction between genres---specifically the realist versus the stream of consciousness. Maybe I need to have some kind of criticism on these styles. Because they seem very important. The whole topic of comparative genres seems like it will be crucial to my work. 

## July 9 

So, after a weekend break, today I’ve started on a new list, Queer Modernisms. There will be three major areas:
* Queer Theory
* Queer Fiction
* Queer Autobiography / Journals / Lifewriting in general

Chronologically, it spans from Oscar Wilde to Alison Bechdel. It’s concerned with sexuality, desire, affect, networks, visuality, feminism, and theories of the archives, composition and writing the self. 

I don’t have anything as specific as a rationale, yet. But there are a couple of things I do know and that I can say at this point. 

First is that not all the authors are “queer”. Katherine Mansfield for example. So I’m going to have to redefine “Queer” as something more expansive. The same sex thing is very important. But I think that being *queer* has more to do with an aesthetics or a mode of feeling. (Mansfield is absolutely vital. She brims. She’s ripe for a speculative realist reading. In my view, if Woolf belongs on the list, so does Mansfield. So what is “queer”? It’s a way of feeling…)

Second. I’m not sure about the role that notebooks/autobiography plays against fiction. This is something that will have to be worked out more deliberately. I’m interested in drafts, in looking at histories of textuality and composition practices. So that somehow needs to work its way onto the list. The trace of a piece of writing, the different versions of that piece of writing. Should it really be differentiated from the final piece? Should they be listed together, and separated by other categories besides its “state”? The journals/letters/diaries/autobiographies seem unnecessary to separate. That’s what I’ll do for now. But I’ll continue to think about the interplay.

**Concerning the issue of too many works:**

**Concerning the issue with topics/organization:** 
* Coming at this in retrospect, I think the general “areas” of perception (vision, body, cognition) should get their own topics and then the specific movements (speculative realism, posthuman, empiricism) will also get their own topics. To me, that makes the most sense, because I am interested in perception and also what various trends/groups have to say about it).

**Concerning the issue of research questions:**

## July 5 2018

Starting to feel a bit overwhelmed with how the list is going. I think it’s too much, too many works and divergent topics. I’m not sure the topics cohere. Let me try to sketch them:

Perception ----> Cognition - Vision - Color Theory - Visual Studies - Affect Theory
Philosophical -----> Speculative Realism - Philosophy of Mind - Empiricism - The Posthuman - Literary theory (or language)

It seems like Affect Theory belongs in Perception, though it could also belong in Philosophical traditions, I’m not sure. A similar difficulty with the posthuman, or maybe not. 

(reflecting on this in the future, I think the list is divided into topics that more immediately study perception and topics that study more established fields that study perception.)

Affect and Posthuman are both very contemporary fields. But if I were to arrange this chronologically that would make no sense. Many of these topics are already driven or organized around chronological considerations. In any case, if I were to do that, I would have something like, “Contemporary Fields of Perception” or “Feeling in the Tech-Age”.

One thing is for sure. There is a body of scientific discourse, and another of philosophical (and then of cultural (visual studies). 

## July 4 2018

Yesterday I read review for books on the topic “Bodies and Technology / Posthuman / Forgetting the Physical”, including especially work by Donna Haraway, Katherine N Hayles, and some Cyberfeminism. I originally created this topic because, just like I have sections on “vision” and “cognition”, I thought I should have one on bodies. But, as I was populating it, I realized that it’s mostly to do with feminist approaches that question the method of scientific and technological discourse. What I thought was more about feeling/affect actually turns out to be about methodology… Or at least very much entwined with discourse in scientific inquiry. Are Haraway and Hayles more about correcting historical notions or about proposing new notions--- “putting the body back in”? Brian Massumi, who is also on this list, has a stake in critical discourse as well. He’s against structuralism, like Haraway and Hayles criticize enlightenment/modernity. So I guess they do, after all, engage. Bodies & Discourse on Bodies. 

Today I worked on my “vision” section, which actually mutated into two sections: “visual studies” and “color theory”. Visual studies contains historical perspectives on vision, and how vision is connected/constructed by culture. This list includes mostly WJT Mitchell, Jonathan Crary, Johanna Drucker. But it also will include some more historical tracts and secondary overviews of the history of vision, such as “Micrographia” by Robert Hooke. What I want is to get a kind of trajectory for how ideas about vision and how vision worked evolved through history and for more contemporary accounts of how modernity relates to visual culture. For the color theory list I have Newton, Goethe, and Wittgenstein. Here I’m really just interested in tracing their trans-historical debate, to follow the trends and the discourse. To get an up close idea of how people debated vision and color. This is as much about discourse/method as it is about optics. 

## July 2 2018

Today I did some research on Alfred North Whitehead, the Speculative Realists, and I began my “technofeminism” list that I will complete tomorrow. I also read “Bliss” by Katherine Mansfield. 

The field of Speculative Realism is heavily dominated by men---all the articles in *Speculations* and *Collapse* that I could find. I think there’s an opportunity for a feminist perspective, or to frame the Speculative Realist insight---process philosophy--- knowing things in themselves---as a queer intervention. 

Speaking of queer interventions, there are a lot of stakes flying around in my mind. 
The stakes are:
* teaching --- pedagogy --- how can we enhance this with technology? (something I’m trying to achieve with my ITP work, which is essentially about how technology engages affect to enhance teaching)
* feminist/queer --- not quite sure what my question is here --- maybe it’s something about engaging absent queerness in literature? Creating or describing (absent, latent, apparent) networks of queerness? Networks of feeling that are queer? (I’m saying all of this and I’m aware that it falls under the hermeneutics of suspicion. I don’t want to be suspicious. I want to revel in the feeling.)
* the method --- the methodology must be speculative. It must mix criticism with creativity in some way. It must---in Jerome McGann’s words---allow us to “imagine what we don’t know”. 

I think now, in reflection that these three concerns form the seeds of each of my lists.
*the means will be digital, the methodology will be speculative*
*the focus or target will be the feeling, affect*
*the content will be queer---queer lives, queer feelings*

## June 30 2018

Today and yesterday I have been reading book reviews for various works in cognitive studies and neuroscience. These books will form one subsection of my list--- “theories of perception and philosophies of mind”. 

I’m interested in this topic because I think it will allow me to bridge feeling/affect and technology. How does technology affect the way we feel? In particular, I’m interested in *how the digital can stimulate new feelings about literature*. That is actually very broad, not particular at all. 

There are some practical questions:
* How can we build tools that engage feeling, affect, during the reading process?
* And, turning from the reader’s side of things, and toward the writer’s, how can we use text analysis to mine feeling in the words, phrases, syntax, format itself?

Texts are networks waiting to be mapped. There is an ecology of feeling, affect, emotion in all this writing.

So I guess that this entry is just to say that studying the brain and cognitive processes will help me to better understand how feeling happens in the mind and the feeling mind’s connection/stimulation by technology. 

This all seems very ambitious.
