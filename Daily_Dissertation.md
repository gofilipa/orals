# Daily Dissertation

## June 30 2018

Today and yesterday I have been reading book reviews for various works in cognitive studies and neuroscience. These books will form one subsection of my list--- “theories of perception and philosophies of mind”. 

I’m interested in this topic because I think it will allow me to bridge feeling/affect and technology. How does technology affect the way we feel? In particular, I’m interested in *how the digital can stimulate new feelings about literature*. That is actually very broad, not particular at all. 

There are some practical questions:
* How can we build tools that engage feeling, affect, during the reading process?
* And, turning from the reader’s side of things, and toward the writer’s, how can we use text analysis to mine feeling in the words, phrases, syntax, format itself?

Texts are networks waiting to be mapped. There is an ecology of feeling, affect, emotion in all this writing.

So I guess that this entry is just to say that studying the brain and cognitive processes will help me to better understand how feeling happens in the mind and the feeling mind’s connection/stimulation by technology. 

This all seems very ambitious.

## July 2 2018

Today I did some research on Alfred North Whitehead, the Speculative Realists, and I began my “technofeminism” list that I will complete tomorrow. I also read “Bliss” by Katherine Mansfield. 

The field of Speculative Realism is heavily dominated by men---all the articles in *Speculations* and *Collapse* that I could find. I think there’s an opportunity for a feminist perspective, or to frame the Speculative Realist insight---process philosophy--- knowing things in themselves---as a queer intervention. 

Speaking of queer interventions, there are a lot of stakes flying around in my mind. 
The stakes are:
* teaching --- pedagogy --- how can we enhance this with technology? (something I’m trying to achieve with my ITP work, which is essentially about how technology engages affect to enhance teaching)
* feminist/queer --- not quite sure what my question is here --- maybe it’s something about engaging absent queerness in literature? Creating or describing (absent, latent, apparent) networks of queerness? Networks of feeling that are queer? (I’m saying all of this and I’m aware that it falls under the hermeneutics of suspicion. I don’t want to be suspicious. I want to revel in the feeling.)
* the method --- the methodology must be speculative. It must mix criticism with creativity in some way. It must---in Jerome McGann’s words---allow us to “imagine what we don’t know”. 

I think now, in reflection that these three concerns form the seeds of each of my lists.
*the means will be digital, the methodology will be speculative*
*the focus or target will be the feeling, affect*
*the content will be queer---queer lives, queer feelings*

## July 4 2018

Yesterday I read review for books on the topic “Bodies and Technology / Posthuman / Forgetting the Physical”, including especially work by Donna Haraway, Katherine N Hayles, and some Cyberfeminism. I originally created this topic because, just like I have sections on “vision” and “cognition”, I thought I should have one on bodies. But, as I was populating it, I realized that it’s mostly to do with feminist approaches that question the method of scientific and technological discourse. What I thought was more about feeling/affect actually turns out to be about methodology… Or at least very much entwined with discourse in scientific inquiry. Are Haraway and Hayles more about correcting historical notions or about proposing new notions--- “putting the body back in”? Brian Massumi, who is also on this list, has a stake in critical discourse as well. He’s against structuralism, like Haraway and Hayles criticize enlightenment/modernity. So I guess they do, after all, engage. Bodies & Discourse on Bodies. 

Today I worked on my “vision” section, which actually mutated into two sections: “visual studies” and “color theory”. Visual studies contains historical perspectives on vision, and how vision is connected/constructed by culture. This list includes mostly WJT Mitchell, Jonathan Crary, Johanna Drucker. But it also will include some more historical tracts and secondary overviews of the history of vision, such as “Micrographia” by Robert Hooke. What I want is to get a kind of trajectory for how ideas about vision and how vision worked evolved through history and for more contemporary accounts of how modernity relates to visual culture. For the color theory list I have Newton, Goethe, and Wittgenstein. Here I’m really just interested in tracing their trans-historical debate, to follow the trends and the discourse. To get an up close idea of how people debated vision and color. This is as much about discourse/method as it is about optics. 

## July 5 2018

Starting to feel a bit overwhelmed with how the list is going. I think it’s too much, too many works and divergent topics. I’m not sure the topics cohere. Let me try to sketch them:

Perception ----> Cognition - Vision - Color Theory - Visual Studies - Affect Theory
Philosophical -----> Speculative Realism - Philosophy of Mind - Empiricism - The Posthuman - Literary theory (or language)

It seems like Affect Theory belongs in Perception, though it could also belong in Philosophical traditions, I’m not sure. A similar difficulty with the posthuman, or maybe not. 

(reflecting on this in the future, I think the list is divided into topics that more immediately study perception and topics that study more established fields that study perception.)

Affect and Posthuman are both very contemporary fields. But if I were to arrange this chronologically that would make no sense. Many of these topics are already driven or organized around chronological considerations. In any case, if I were to do that, I would have something like, “Contemporary Fields of Perception” or “Feeling in the Tech-Age”.

One thing is for sure. There is a body of scientific discourse, and another of philosophical (and then of cultural (visual studies).

**Concerning the issue of too many works:**

**Concerning the issue with topics/organization:** 
* Coming at this in retrospect, I think the general “areas” of perception (vision, body, cognition) should get their own topics and then the specific movements (speculative realism, posthuman, empiricism) will also get their own topics. To me, that makes the most sense, because I am interested in perception and also what various trends/groups have to say about it). 

**Concerning the issue of stakes:**

**Concerning the issue of research questions:**

## July 9 

So, after a weekend break, today I’ve started on a new list, Queer Modernisms. There will be three major areas:
* Queer Theory
* Queer Fiction
* Queer Autobiography / Journals / Lifewriting in general

Chronologically, it spans from Oscar Wilde to Alison Bechdel. It’s concerned with sexuality, desire, affect, networks, visuality, feminism, and theories of the archives, composition and writing the self. 

I don’t have anything as specific as a rationale, yet. But there are a couple of things I do know and that I can say at this point. 

First is that not all the authors are “queer”. Katherine Mansfield for example. So I’m going to have to redefine “Queer” as something more expansive. The same sex thing is very important. But I think that being *queer* has more to do with an aesthetics or a mode of feeling. (Mansfield is absolutely vital. She brims. She’s ripe for a speculative realist reading. In my view, if Woolf belongs on the list, so does Mansfield. So what is “queer”? It’s a way of feeling…)

Second. I’m not sure about the role that notebooks/autobiography plays against fiction. This is something that will have to be worked out more deliberately. I’m interested in drafts, in looking at histories of textuality and composition practices. So that somehow needs to work its way onto the list. The trace of a piece of writing, the different versions of that piece of writing. Should it really be differentiated from the final piece? Should they be listed together, and separated by other categories besides its “state”? The journals/letters/diaries/autobiographies seem unnecessary to separate. That’s what I’ll do for now. But I’ll continue to think about the interplay. 

## July 11

Day three of my Queer Modernisms list. And I don’t feel as if I’ve accomplished enough. Still in the stage of assembling and collecting readings, adding things that I’ll have to vet later, probably too much and it’s too early to see what kind of shape it will take. 

There are a few categories that I’m sure of:

* Queer Theory --- includes some race, futurity, as well as greatest hits like Foucault, Butler, Halberstam, etc.
* Fiction --- Decadence (Wilde, Rachilde, Fields?); High Modernism (Woolf, Barnes, Stein, Mansfield, Cather?); Postmodernism (Baldwin?, Delany?, Moraga?)
* Autobiography --- Delany, Bechdel, Myles, Edmund White, Barthes, Colette?, Anzaldua
* Lesbian pulp / classics ?
* Women Writers Criticism --- Shari Benstock
* Literary Theory ?

Maybe my postmodern list can be specified as “postmodern autobiography” or “memoir” or “life writing”.

I’m really only interested in modernist *fiction* and postmodern *nonfiction* or *memoir*. Woolf’s Orlando being the fulcrum between those two. This idea actually really excites me. Maybe I can also include Wilde and Rachilde into the modern… though this would destroy the woman focus. 

As I was reading *Well of Loneliness* today I also had another thought about the distinction between genres---specifically the realist versus the stream of consciousness. Maybe I need to have some kind of criticism on these styles. Because they seem very important. The whole topic of comparative genres seems like it will be crucial to my work. 

## July 13

The Queer Modernisms list is going well. I’ve set a scheme for topics:

* Theories of gender, sexuality, race
* Queer Affects
* Fiction (incl protomodernist, high modernist, post modern, autobio & experimental writing
* Journals / Diaries / manuscripts
* Womens’ writing theories

This gives me a bit of anxiety, but I think it will go well. Today I honed down “theories” and tomorrow I will do “affects”. I think I need a whole week---next week---to shape the “fiction” section, and journals/diaries/manus.

## July 15

Today I took it a little easy. I worked on my Queer Affects list. Though I’m changing the title to Queer Affects and Time. Not only are the common topics among the works, but I also think that they are means of connection or vitality in queer writing. 

So one of the problems is distinguishing this list from the Sex, Gender, and Race list alongside it. Right now I’m conceiving the break as temporal. That is, that many of the arguments and texts actually belong in Sex, Gender, Race but that there was a development of thought more toward emotion, affect, time. So that’s one way of distinguishing them. That Affect Theory is a natural or logical outgrowth of feminist critique, of queer critique. I know nothing about queerness. Or affect. I really need to spend more time reading criticism on it. 

## July 24

Back at this. 

Last week (yesterday) I finished (sort of) my Queer Modernisms list. So far, it feels much less coherent than the theories of perception. I have two main categories of criticism --- sex, gender, and race & queer affects/temporalities. But then things become more eclectic. The literature is divided into four categories:

* Protomodernism --- Pater, Wilde, James, and Vernon Lee? 
* Modernism --- Woolf, Barnes, Stein, Mansfield, Isherwood!, Hall, Colette
* Postmodernism --- Baldwin?, Feinburg?, Highsmith, Waters (things are getting very eclectic)
* Experimental Writing / Autobio / Manus --- Mansfield, Woolf, Delany, Bechdel, Myles… 

I want to trace affects in queer writing. I want to use technology to trace affects in queer writing. 

Many of these books are sad, depressing, but that’s a major part of being queer! There’s also the anger. There’s also the sense of being out of time. 

I think I need to step up my memoir game. 

Now I actually feel better about this. My queer modernisms list is all about feeling queer --- what it means to feel queer. How we can examine/exhume new ways of being queer?

I need to look at more notebooks. I also need to add more visual memoir and life writing. 

## July 26

So this is my second day of working on the digital list. So far I have researched three sub-topics: 
* methods --- includes scientific method and digital and digital textuality and theories of reading, hermeneutics
* networks --- internet cables, wireless networks, social media, histories of the internet, cloud, communications and network theory
* language --- hypertext studies, hypertext/cyber fiction, reading/writing on the machine, programming languages and poetics. 

You can see that these topics aren’t very tight. Things get a bit more complex with my media section. There’s a fine line between paper/print/digital formats and then of programming languages. Media I’ll approach more as media archaeology. And as vitality. Though this line of vitality in media also runs through language. I think these distinctions will work themselves out. 

I’m including Caitlin Fisher’s *These Waves of Girls* because I love it and it’s had such a big influence on me / hypertext writing. Wish I could find more works like that one… 

This list is in many ways the one I’m most excited about. It’s foundational. The ideas are the reason that I’ve wanted to study literature at the PhD level. 

Books like Galloway’s *Protocol* or Ramsay’s *Reading Machines* excite me like no other. There is so much potential to be had. A whole terrain of feeling that underlies the way we use technology and the books that we read. My dissertation aims to uncover these embedded feelings. Not that they are hiding (*not* a hermeneutics of suspicion) but that the are there, waiting to be felt, if only one can approach them from a position of ignorance, defamiliarization, speculation. A hermeneutics of wonder… A speculative method.

## October 20

It's been a while. I've been anxious about my Queer Modernisms list. I feel that I really ought to be developing a focus at this point. From what I've been hearing lately, and a perspective that I'm trying to adopt, is that I just need to finish the damn thing. I need to really start conceiving of my dissertation not as an impending revelation but as an imminent project. I need to pursue what I know I already like, what is within my reach.

What do I already like? I like notebooks, journals, histories of composition, speculation, the potentials of form. 

*Histories of composition* (Now I will revise my QM list to reflect this focus.)

Joseph Allen Boone's *Libidinal Currents* --- the affect of close reading.
Csvetkovitch *An Archive of Feelings* --- "acting out" as an archive, as a public act.

Feelings of impending rejection from my desired committee members. I feel fundamentally lost. But also realizing that I'm so much stronger, smarter, have gone futher than I give myself credit for. 

What is within my reach? This interest in journals, in composing. I'm interested in the first draft. The pen against paper, momentum, the errata of daily life, the sunlight against paper. In archives, histories, real stories. 

Question --- in what ways do technologies of digitization and mediation facilitate new interpretations/readings of this kind of work?

I've just removed many works from my Theory, Protomodernism, and High Modernism topcs. Removing novels by James, Cther, which I either haven't read or don't sense that they will be terribly interesting to me. That is to say that I am focusing. Narrowing down. Aiming for things already within my reach; and it feels good.

## October 24 

Again revisiting QM list. The revelation of doing *journals* as a focus still has an encouraging effect on me. (though Wayne still hasn't written back, which keeps me anxious and full of dread)

I'm revising my High Modernist Fiction list to "Modernist Autobiography". It seems to me that many of these works are actually autobiographical, to a certain extent:
* *Orlando*
* *The Autobiography of Alice B Toklas*
* Colette
* *Nightwood*
* Isherwood

I mean that there's a thin line between reality and fiction. That these stories draw from life. Others in this list which do not fit so nicely:
* *Jacob's Room*
* *Well of Loneliness*
* K. Mansfield's short stories

So what to do about this? Keep them as anomalies? Or maybe... and this excites me... after I'm done delineating all the autobiographical stuff I'll be left with all of these kind of unbelievable and fantastical novels that make up their own genre. The outcasts will form their own classification, their own community, in other words. 

This idea of *Modernist Autobiography* comes to me from Georgia Johnson's *Formation of Modernist lesbian Autobiography*, which has a helpful introduction. The topic of autobiography is paramount. Because it brings into question the function of *identity* --writing subjects in relation to the intended audience---something that is always interesting to me. It enhances the role of the speaking "I". The difficulty of categorizing, encoding queer identities. 

Question---*What hapens when you combine the encoding of queer identity and nonverbal annotion or engaging emotion/affect of the reader?*
* how does affect relate to identity?
* how does what I feel when I read relate to the identities embedded in the text?

In the ["Torment of Queer Literature"](https://therumpus.net/2018/06/the-torment-of-queer-literature/), the writer talks about identification through negative emotions---shame, terror, panic, stigma. The fear of reading yourself into the characters. The isolation of doing so. The fear when you encounter a mirror of your pain and suffering. The fear of being represented and not represented. The fear of finding yourself on the page as a marginalized subject.
