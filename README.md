# Welcome to my Orals Prep

This project collects my reading lists, journals, brainstorms, and tentative schedule as I plan and study for my Orals Examination for April/May 2019. Beyond storing bibliographic information that will be useful for me later, it is also a public-facing record that traces my thinking as it develops toward the disseration. 

As of now, my three Orals lists center on the following topics:
* [**Digital Studies and Textuality**](/digital_list.md)
* [**Theories of Perception and the Mind**](/perception_list.md)
* [**Queer Modernisms and Affects**](/queer_modernisms_list.md)

The above lists are large in scope and content, containing about 50-60 texts each. I will need to cut these down to about half that number, so my final lists will contain between 20-30 texts each. 

In addition to the above, I also include a file, [**"Daily Dissertation"**](/Daily_Dissertation.md), that logs my developing thoughts as I compile these lists. The entries here have been transcribed from a notebook where they were originally written, periodically through the summer of 2018, when I spent the most time researching books and articles. As it stands, the log is most useful for the way it continually poses the questions that drive my reearch, considers the reasoning behind including certain authors and topics, and attempts to define the stakes of my intervention. 

My next goal is to cut down and finalize these lists. I hope to have final versions by the end of December 2018.
