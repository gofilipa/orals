### Welcome to my Orals Prep

This project collects my reading lists, rationales, and journal entries as I plan and study for my Orals Examination for May 15, 2019. Beyond storing bibliographic and other information that will be useful for me later, it is also a public-facing record that traces my thinking as it develops toward the disseration. 

As of now, my three Orals lists center on the following topics:
* [**Digital Methods, Objects, and Metaphors**](/digital_list.md)
* [**Theories of Perception**](/perception_list.md)
* [**Queer Subjects and Affects**](/queer_list.md)

In particular, my [**"Orals Journal"**](/journal.md), logs my developing thoughts as I compile and revise these lists. The entries began in the summer of 2018 and continue to the present day, and are updated, on average, about once a week. Though above lists contain 25-30 works each, a glance at the Daily Dissertation and revision history indicates that they were much larger in scope and content, each containing about 50-60 texts at the outset. As it stands, the journal is most useful for the way it continually poses the questions that drive my research, considers the reasoning behind including and removing certain authors and topics, and attempts to define the stakes of my intervention.
