# Welcome to my Orals

This project collects my reading lists, journals, brainstorms, and tentative schedule as I plan and study for my Orals Examination for April/May 2019. Beyond storing bibliographic information that will be useful for me later, it is also a public-facing record that traces my thinking as it develops toward the disseration. 

As of now, my three Orals lists center on the following topics:
* Digital Studies and Textuality
* Theories of Perception and the Mind
* Queer Modernisms and Affects

The file, [**"Daily Dissertation"**](/Daily_Dissertation.md), is a log of my thoughts as I compile a rough sketch of readings for each of my three lists. The entries here have been transcribed from a notebook where they were originally written, through the summer of 2018, when I spent a month researching books and articles for each of my lists. The resulting lists are only a first attempt toward finalized lists, and they need to be significantly cut down. The goal for the fall of 2018 is to finalize these lists. As it stands, the log is most useful for the way it continually poses the questions that drive my reearch, considers the reasoning behind including certain authors and topics, and attempts to define the stakes of my intervention.
